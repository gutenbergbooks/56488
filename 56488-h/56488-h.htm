<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In this volume</span>, the chapters descriptive of the structure
and habits of the wild elephant are reprinted for the
sixth time from a larger work,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> published originally in
1859. Since the appearance of the First Edition, many
corrections and much additional matter have been
supplied to me, chiefly from India and Ceylon, and will
be found embodied in the following pages.</p>

<p>To one of these in particular I feel bound to direct
attention. In the course of a more enlarged essay on the
zoology of Ceylon,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> amongst other proofs of a geological
origin for that island, distinct from that of the
adjacent continent of India, as evidenced by peculiarities
in the flora and fauna of each respectively, I had occasion
to advert to a discovery which had been recently announced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
by Temminck in his <i>Survey of the Dutch possessions
in the Indian Archipelago</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> that the elephant which
abounds in Sumatra (although unknown in the adjacent
island of Java), and which had theretofore been regarded
as identical in species with the Indian one, has been
found to possess peculiarities, in which it differs as much
from the elephant of India as the latter does from its
African congener. On this new species, to which the
natives give the name of “<i>gadjah</i>,” <span class="smcap">Temminck</span> has
conferred the scientific designation of the <i>Elephas Sumatranus</i>.
The points which entitle it to this distinction
he enumerates minutely in the work<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> before alluded to,
and they have been summarized as follows by Prince
Lucien Bonaparte.</p>

<p>“This species is perfectly intermediate between the
Indian and African, especially in the shape of the skull,
and will certainly put an end to the distinction between
<i>Elephas</i> and <i>Loxodon</i>, with those who admit that anatomical
genus; since although the crowns of the teeth of
<i>E. Sumatranus</i> are more like the Asiatic animal, still the
less numerous undulated ribbons of enamel are nearly
quite as wide as those forming the lozenges of the African.
The number of pairs of false ribs (which alone vary, the
true ones being always six) is fourteen, one less than in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
the <i>Africanus</i>, <i>one</i> more than in the <i>Indicus</i>; and so it is
with the dorsal vertebræ, which are twenty in the <i>Sumatranus</i>
(<i>twenty-one</i> and <i>nineteen</i> in the others), whilst the
new species agrees with <i>Africanus</i> in the number of
sacral vertebræ (<i>four</i>), and with <i>Indicus</i> in that of the
caudal ones, which are <i>thirty-four</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Schlegel</span> of Leyden, in a paper lately
submitted by him to the Royal Academy of Sciences
of Holland, (the substance of which he obligingly
communicated to me, through Baron Bentinck the Netherlands
Minister at this Court), confirmed the identity
of the Ceylon elephant with that found in the
Lampongs of Sumatra. The osteological comparison of
which <span class="smcap">Temminck</span> has given the results was, he says, conducted
by himself with access to four skeletons of the
latter; and the more recent opportunity of comparing
a living Sumatran elephant with one from Bengal, served
to establish other though minor points of divergence.
The Indian species is more robust and powerful;
the proboscis longer and more slender; and the extremity,
(a point in which the elephant of Sumatra resembles
that of Africa,) is more flattened and provided with
coarser and longer hair than that of India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span></p>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Schlegel</span>, adverting to the large export of
elephants from Ceylon to the Indian continent, which
has been carried on from time immemorial, suggests the
caution with which naturalists, in investigating this
question, should first satisfy themselves whether the elephants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
they examine are really natives of the mainland,
or whether they have been brought to it from the islands.
“The extraordinary fact,” he observes in his letter to me,
“of the identity thus established between the elephants
of Ceylon and Sumatra, and the points in which they are
found to differ from that of Bengal, leads to the question
whether all the elephants of the Asiatic continent belong
to one single species; or whether these vast regions may
not produce in some quarter as yet unexplored the one
hitherto found only in the two islands referred to? It is
highly desirable that naturalists who have the means and
opportunity, should exert themselves to discover, whether
any traces are to be found of the Ceylon elephant in the
Dekkan; or of that of Sumatra in Cochin China or
Siam.”</p>

<p>To me the establishment of a fact so conclusively confirmatory
of the theory I had ventured to broach, was
productive of great satisfaction. But in an essay by <span class="smcap">Dr.
Falconer</span>, since published in the <i>Natural History
Review</i> for January 1863, “On the Living and Extinct
Species of Elephants,” he adduces reasons for questioning
the accuracy of these views as to <i>Elephas Sumatranus</i>.
The idea of a specific distinction between the elephants of
India and Ceylon, Dr. Falconer shows to have been propounded
as far back as 1834, by Mr. B. H. Hodgson, the
eminent ethnologist and explorer of the zoology of Nepal;
Dr. Falconer’s own inspection however of the examples of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
both as preserved in the Museum of Leyden, not only
did not lead him to accept the later conclusion of
<span class="smcap">Schlegel</span> and <span class="smcap">Temminck</span>, but induced him to doubt
the correctness of the statements published by the Prince
of Canino, both as to the external and the osteological
characters of the Indian elephant. As to the former, he
declares that the differences between it and the elephant
of Ceylon are so trifling, as not to exceed similar peculiarities
observable between elephants taken in different
regions of continental India, where an experienced
mahout will tell at a glance, whether a newly captured
animal was taken in the Sal forests of the North-Western
Provinces, in Assam, in Silhet, Chittagong, Tipperah, or
Cuttack. The osteological distinctions and the odontography,
Dr. Falconer contends, are insufficient to sustain
the alleged separateness of species. He equally discredits
the alleged differences regarding the ribs and dorsal
vertebræ, and he concludes that, “on a review of the
whole case, the evidence in every aspect appears to him
to fail in showing that the elephant of Ceylon and
Sumatra is of a species distinct from that of continental
India.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> He thinks it right, however, to add, that the
subject is one which “should be thoroughly investigated,”
as the hasty assumption that the elephants of Ceylon and
Sumatra belong to distinct species has been put forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
to support the conjecture of a geological formation for
the island of Ceylon distinct from that of the mainland
of India; a proposition to which Dr. Falconer is not
prepared to accede.</p>

<p>Having ventured to originate the latter theory, and
having sustained it by Schlegel’s authority as regards the
elephant of Sumatra, I think it is incumbent on me to
give becoming prominence to the opposite view entertained
by one so eminently entitled to consideration as
Dr. Falconer.</p>

<p>In the course of my observations on the structure and
functions of the elephant, I have ventured an opinion
that an animal of such ponderous and peculiar construction,
is formed chiefly for progression by easy and steady
paces, and is too weighty and unwieldy to leap, at least
to any considerable height or distance. But this opinion
I felt bound to advance with reserve, as I had seen
in an interesting article in the <i>Colombo Observer</i> for
March 1866, descriptive of a recent corral, the statement
that an infuriated elephant had “fairly leaped a
barrier 15 feet high, only carrying away the upper crossbeam
with a crash.” (See p. 40.) Doubtful of some
inaccuracy in the measurements, I took the precaution of
writing to Mr. Ferguson, the editor, to solicit further
enquiry. Since the following pages have been printed, I
have received from that gentleman the correction, which
I now subjoin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear Sir Emerson,—I have just had a letter from
Mr. Samuel Jayetileke, the Cutchery Modliar of Kornegalle,
in reply to my queries about the height of the
fence over which the elephant sprang. The result is the
usual one whenever exact measurements are substituted
for guess-work: I stated 15 feet as the height of the
fence, and this was the information given to me at the
time. But the report of Kumbowattewene, the Ratemahat-meya
who has since gone to measure the place, is,
that where the elephant leaped over, the height was 12
feet. The exact height of the leap was however only
9 feet; for besides that in his rush he knocked away the
top bar, it is found that in the corner at which he escaped,
there is a mound formed by a white ant’s nest, two and
a half feet high, on which he must have climbed to
help him over. I trust this information may be in time
to prevent my original statement from going forth without
modification in your new book. The leap is still a pretty
good one.—Yours faithfully, <span class="smcap">A. M. Ferguson</span>, <i>Observer
Office</i>, Colombo, December 14, 1866.”</p>

<small><small>STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS.</small></small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> my residence in Ceylon, I had on two occasions
opportunities of witnessing the operation on a grand
scale, of capturing wild elephants, intended to be trained
for the Government service in the establishment of the
Civil Engineer and Commissioner of Roads;—and in
the course of my frequent journeys through the interior
of the island, I succeeded in collecting so many facts
relative to the habits of these animals so interesting in
a state of nature, as enable me not only to add to the
information previously possessed, but to correct some of
the fallacies popularly entertained regarding their disposition
and instincts. These particulars I am anxious to
place on record before proceeding to describe the scenes
I allude to, during the progress of the elephant hunts in
the district of the Seven Korles, at which I was present
in 1846, and again in 1847.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>With the exception of the narrow but densely inhabited
belt of cultivated land, that extends along the
seaborde from Chilaw on the western coast towards
Tangalle on the south-east, there is no part of Ceylon
in which elephants may not be said to abound; even
close to the environs of the most populous localities of
the interior. They frequent both the open plains and
the deep forests; and their footsteps are to be seen
wherever food and shade, vegetation and water,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> allure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>them, alike on the summits of the loftiest mountains, and
on the borders of the tanks and lowland streams.</p>

<p>From time immemorial the Singhalese have been
taught to capture and tame them, and the export of
elephants from Ceylon to India has been going on without
interruption from the period of the first Punic War.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
In later times in all forests elephants were the property
of the Kandyan crown; and their capture or slaughter
without the royal permission was classed amongst grave
offences in the criminal code.</p>

<p>In recent years there is reason to believe that their
numbers have become considerably reduced. They have
entirely disappeared from localities in which they were
formerly numerous;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> smaller herds have been taken in
the periodical captures for the public service, and hunters
returning from the chase report them to be growing year
by year more and more scarce. In consequence of this
diminution the natives in some parts of the island have
even suspended the ancient practice of keeping watchers
and fires by night to scare away elephants from their
growing crops.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The opening of roads too in the hill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>districts, and the clearing of the mountain forests of
Kandy for the cultivation of coffee, have forced the
animals to retire to the low country, where again they
have been followed by large parties of European sportsmen;
and the Singhalese themselves, being more freely
provided with arms than in former times, have assisted in
swelling the annual slaughter.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Had the motive that incites to the destruction of the
elephant in Africa and India prevailed in Ceylon, that is,
had the elephants there been provided with tusks, they
would long since have been annihilated for the sake of
the ivory.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> But it is a curious fact that, whilst in Africa
and India both sexes have tusks,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> with some slight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>disproportion in the size of those of the females; in
Ceylon, not one elephant in a hundred is found with
tusks, and the few that possess them are exclusively
males. Nearly all, however, have those stunted processes
called <i>tushes</i>, about ten or twelve inches in length
and one or two in diameter. These I have observed
them to use in loosening earth, stripping off bark, and
snapping asunder small branches and climbing plants;
and hence tushes are seldom seen without a groove worn
into them near their extremities.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Amongst other surmises more ingenious than sound,
the general absence of tusks in the elephant of Ceylon
has been associated with the profusion of rivers and
streams in the island; whilst it has been thrown out as
a possibility that in Africa, where water is comparatively
scarce, the animal is equipped with these implements in
order to assist it in digging wells in the sand and in
raising the juicy roots of the mimosas and succulent
plants for the sake of their moisture. In support of this
hypothesis, it has been observed, that whilst the tusks of
the Ceylon species, which are never required for such
uses, are slender, graceful and curved, seldom exceeding
fifty or sixty pounds’ weight, those of the African ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>phant
are straight and thick, weighing occasionally 150
pounds, and even 300 pounds.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> But it is manifestly
inconsistent with the idea that tusks were given to the
elephant to assist in digging for food, to find that the
females are less bountifully supplied with them than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>males, whilst the necessity for their use extends alike to
both sexes. The same consideration serves to demonstrate
the fallacy of the conjecture, that the tusks of the
elephant were given as weapons of offence, for if such
were the case the vast majority of them in Ceylon, males
as well as females, would be left helpless in presence of
an assailant. But although in their conflicts with one
another, those which are provided with tusks may occasionally
push clumsily with them at an opponent, it is a
misapprehension to imagine that tusks are designed, as
has been stated, to serve “in warding off the attacks of
the wily tiger and the furious rhinoceros, often securing
the victory by one blow which transfixes the assailant to
the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>So peaceable and harmless is the life of the elephant,
that nature appears to have left it unprovided with any
special weapon of offence: the trunk is too delicate an
organ to be rudely employed in a conflict with other
animals, and although on an emergency it may push or
gore with its tusks (to which the French have hastily
given the designation of “<i>défenses</i>”), their almost vertical
position, added to the difficulty of raising its head
above the level of the shoulder, is inconsistent with the
idea of their being designed for attack, since it is impossible
for the animal to deliver an effectual blow, or to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>“wield” its tusks as the deer and the buffalo can wield
their horns.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Nor is it easy to conceive under what
circumstances an elephant could have a hostile encounter
with a rhinoceros or a tiger, since their respective pursuits
in a state of nature can in no way conflict.</p>

<p>Towards man the elephant evinces shyness, arising
from love of solitude and dislike of intrusion; any alarm
exhibited at his appearance may be reasonably traced to
the slaughter which has reduced their numbers; and as
some evidence of this, it has always been observed in
Ceylon that an elephant manifests greater impatience of
the presence of a white man than of a native. Were its
instincts to carry it further, or were it influenced by any
feeling of animosity or malignity, it must be apparent that,
as against the prodigious numbers that inhabit the forests
of the island, man would wage an unequal contest, and
that of the two, one or other must long since have been
reduced to a helpless minority.</p>

<p>Official testimony is not wanting in confirmation of this
view: in the returns of 108 coroner’s inquests in Ceylon,
during five years from 1849 to 1855 inclusive, held in
cases of death occasioned by wild animals, 15 are recorded
as having been caused by buffaloes, 6 by croco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>diles,
2 by boars, 1 by a bear, and 68 by serpents (the
great majority of the last class of sufferers being women
and children, who had been bitten during the night), and
16 by elephants. Little more than three fatal accidents
occurring annually on the average of five years, is certainly
a very small proportion in a population estimated
at a million and a half, in an island abounding with
wild elephants, with which, independently of casual encounters,
voluntary conflicts are daily stimulated by the
love of sport or the hope of gain. Were the elephants
instinctively vicious or even highly irritable in their temperament,
the destruction of human life under the circumstances
must have been infinitely greater. It must
also be taken into account, that some of the accidents
recorded may have occurred in the rutting season, when
even tame elephants are subject to fits of temporary fury,
known in India by the term <i>must</i>, in Ceylon <i>mudda</i>,—a
paroxysm which speedily passes away, but during the fury
of which it is dangerous even for the mahout who has
charge of them to approach those ordinarily the gentlest
and most familiar.</p>

<p>Again, the elephant is said to “entertain an extraordinary
dislike to all quadrupeds; that dogs running near it
produce annoyance; that it is alarmed if a hare start
from her form;” and from Pliny to Buffon every naturalist
has asserted its supposed aversion to swine.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>alleged antipathies are in a great degree, if not altogether,
imaginary. The habits of the elephant are essentially
harmless, its wants lead to no rivalry with other animals,
and the food to which it is most attached flourishes in
such luxuriance that abundance of it is obtained without
an effort. In the quiet solitudes of Ceylon, elephants
may be seen browsing peacefully in the immediate
vicinity of other animals, and often in close contact with
them. I have seen groups of deer and wild buffaloes
reclining in the sandy bed of a river in the dry season,
and elephants plucking the branches above and beside
them. They show no impatience in the company of the
elk, the bear, and the wild hog; and on the other hand, I
have never discovered an instance in which these animals
have evinced any apprehension of the elephant. Its
natural timidity, however, is such that it becomes alarmed
on the appearance in the jungle of any animal with whose
form it is not familiar. It is said to be afraid of the
horse; but from my own experience, I should say it is
the horse that is disquieted at the aspect of the elephant.
In the same way, from some unaccountable impulse, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>horse has an antipathy to the camel, and evinces extreme
impatience, both of the sight and the smell of that animal.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
When enraged, an elephant will not hesitate to
charge a rider on horseback; but it is against the man,
not against the horse, that his fury is directed; and no
instance has been ever known of his wantonly assailing a
horse. A horse belonging to the late Major Rogers<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> had
run away from his groom, and was found some considerable
time afterwards grazing quietly with a herd of elephants.
In <span class="smcap">De Bry’s</span> splendid collection of travels, however,
there is included <i>The voyage of a certain Englishman
to Cambay</i>; in which the author asserts that at Agra,
in the year 1607, he was present at a spectacle given by
the viceregent of the great Mogul, in the course of which
he saw an elephant destroy two horses, by seizing them in
its trunk, and crushing them with his tusks and feet.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
But this display was avowedly an artificial one, and the
creature must have been cruelly trained and tutored for
the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>Pigs are constantly to be seen feeding about the
stables of tame elephants, which manifest no repugnance
to them. As to smaller animals, the elephant undoubtedly
evinces uneasiness at the presence of a dog, but
this is referable to the same cause as its impatience of a
horse, namely, that neither is habitually seen by it in the
forest; and it would be idle to suppose that this feeling
could amount to hostility against a creature incapable of
inflicting on it the slightest injury.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> The truth I apprehend
to be that, when they meet, the impudence and
impertinences of the dog are offensive to the gravity of
the elephant, and incompatible with his love of solitude
and noiseless repose. Or, as regards the horse and the
dog, may it be assumed as an evidence of the sagacity
of the elephant, that the only two animals to which it
manifests an antipathy, are the two which it has seen
only in the company of its greatest enemy, man? One
instance has certainly been attested to me by an eyewitness,
in which the trunk of an elephant was seized in
the teeth of a Scotch terrier, and such was the alarm of
the huge creature that it came at once to its knees. The
dog repeated the attack, and on every renewal of it the
elephant retreated in terror, holding its trunk above its
head, and kicking at the terrier with its fore feet. It
would have turned to flight but for the interference of its
keeper.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>
<p>Major Skinner, formerly commissioner of roads in
Ceylon, whose official duties in constructing highways
involved the necessity of his being in the jungle for
months together, always found that, by night or by day,
the barking of a dog which accompanied him was sufficient
to put a herd of wild elephants to flight. On the
whole, therefore, I am of opinion that in a state of
nature the elephant lives on terms of amity with every
animal in the forest, that it neither regards them as
its foes, nor provokes their hostility by its acts; and
that, with the exception of man, its greatest enemy
is a fly!</p>

<p>These current statements as to the supposed animosity
of the elephant to minor animals originated with Ælian
and Pliny, who had probably an opportunity of seeing,
what may at any time be observed, that when a captive
elephant is picketed beside a post, the domestic animals,
goats, sheep, and cattle, will annoy and irritate it by
their audacity in making free with its provender; but
this is an evidence in itself of the little instinctive dread
which such comparatively puny creatures entertain of
one so powerful and yet so gentle.</p>

<p>Amongst elephants themselves, jealousy and other
causes of irritation frequently occasion contentions between
individuals of the same herd; but on such occasions
their general habit is to strike with their trunks,
and to bear down their opponents with their heads. It
is doubtless correct that an elephant, when prostrated by
the force and fury of an antagonist of its own species, is
often wounded by the downward pressure of the tusks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
which in any other position it would be almost impossible
to use offensively.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Mr. Mercer, who in 1846 was the principal civil officer
of Government at Badulla, sent me a jagged fragment
of an elephant’s tusk, about five inches in diameter, and
weighing between twenty and thirty pounds, which had
been brought to him by some natives, who, being attracted
by a noise in the jungle, witnessed a combat
between a tusker and one without tusks, and saw the
latter with his trunk seize one of the tusks of his antagonist
and wrench from it the portion in question, which
measured two feet in length.</p>

<p>Here the trunk was shown to be the more powerful
offensive weapon of the two; but I apprehend that the
chief reliance of the elephant for defence is on its ponderous
weight, the pressure of its foot being sufficient
to crush any minor assailant after being prostrated by
means of its trunk. Besides, in using its feet for this
purpose, it derives a wonderful facility from the peculiar
formation of the knee-joint in the hind leg, which, enabling
it to swing the hind feet forward close to the
ground, assists it to toss the body alternately from foot
to foot, till deprived of life.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>A sportsman who had partially undergone this operation,
having been seized by a wounded elephant but
escaped from its fury, described to me his sufferings as
he was thus flung back and forward between the hind
and fore feet of the animal, which ineffectually attempted
to trample him at each concussion, and abandoned him
without inflicting serious injury.</p>

<p>Knox, in describing the execution of criminals by the
state elephants of the former kings of Kandy, says,
“they will run their teeth (<i>tusks</i>) through the body, and
then tear it in pieces and throw it limb from limb;” but
a Kandyan chief, who was witness to these scenes, assured
me that the elephant never once applied its tusks,
but, placing its foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off
his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of the
trunk. If the tusks were designed to be employed offensively,
some alertness would naturally be exhibited in
using them; but in numerous instances where sportsmen
have fallen into the power of a wounded elephant, they
have escaped through the failure of the enraged animal
to strike them with its tusks, even when stretched upon
the ground.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>But here there arises a further and a very curious
enquiry, as to the specific objects in the economy of the
elephant, to which its tusks are conducive. Placed as
it is in Ceylon, in the midst of the most luxuriant profusion
of its favourite food, in close proximity at all
times to abundant supplies of water, and with no natural
enemies against whom to protect itself, it is difficult to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>conjecture any probable utility which it can derive from
such appendages. Their absence is unaccompanied by
any inconvenience to the individuals in whom they are
wanting; and as regards the few who possess them, the
only operations in which I am aware of their tusks being
employed in relation to the habits of the animal, is to
assist in ripping open the stem of the jaggery palms and
young palmyras to extract the farinaceous core; and in
splitting up the juicy shaft of the plantain. Whilst the
tuskless elephant crushes the latter under foot, thereby
soiling it and wasting its moisture; the other, by opening
it with the point of its tusk, performs the operation with
delicacy and apparent ease.</p>

<p>These, however, are trivial and almost accidental advantages:
on the other hand, owing to irregularities in
their growth, the tusks are sometimes an impediment to
the animal in feeding;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and in more than one instance
in the Government studs, tusks which had so grown as
to approach and cross one another at the extremities,
have had to be relieved by the saw; the contraction of
space between them so impeding the free action of the
trunk as to prevent the animal from conveying branches
to its mouth.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>It is true that in captivity, and after a due course of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>training, the elephant discovers a new use for its tusks
when employed in moving stones and piling timber; so
much so that a powerful one will raise and carry on them
a log of half a ton weight or more. One evening, whilst
riding in the vicinity of Kandy, towards the scene of
the massacre of Major Davie’s party in 1803, my horse
evinced some excitement at a noise which approached
us in the thick jungle, and which consisted of a repetition
of the ejaculation <i>urmph! urmph!</i> in a hoarse and
dissatisfied tone. A turn in the forest explained the
mystery, by bringing me face to face with a tame elephant,
unaccompanied by any attendant. He was labouring
painfully to carry a heavy beam of timber, which
he balanced across his tusks, but the pathway being
narrow, he was forced to bend his head to one side to
permit the load to pass endways; and the exertion and
this inconvenience combined led him to utter the dissatisfied
sounds which disturbed the composure of my
horse. On seeing us halt, the elephant raised his head,
reconnoitred us for a moment, then flung down the
timber, and voluntarily forced himself backwards among
the brushwood so as to leave a passage, of which he expected
us to avail ourselves. My horse hesitated: the
elephant observed it, and impatiently thrust himself still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>deeper into the jungle, repeating his cry of <i>urmph!</i> but
in a voice evidently meant to encourage us to advance.
Still the horse trembled; and anxious to observe the
instinct of the two sagacious animals, I laid the rein upon
its neck and forbore any interference: again the elephant
of his own accord wedged himself further in
amongst the trees, and manifested some impatience that
we did not pass him. At length the horse moved forward;
and when we were fairly past the elephant I looked
back and saw the wise creature stoop and take up its
unwieldy burthen, trim and balance it on its tusks, and
resume its route as before, hoarsely snorting its discontented
remonstrance.</p>

<p>Between the African elephant and that of Ceylon,
with the exception of the striking peculiarity of the
infrequency of tusks in the latter, the distinctions are
less apparent to a casual observer than to a scientific
naturalist. In the Ceylon species the forehead is higher
and more hollow, the ears are smaller, and, in a section
of the teeth, the grinding ridges, instead of being
lozenge-shaped, are transverse bars of uniform breadth.</p>

<p>The Indian elephant is stated by Cuvier to have four
nails on the hind foot, the African variety having only
three; but amongst the perfections of a high-bred elephant
of Ceylon, is always enumerated the possession
of <i>twenty</i> nails, whilst those of a secondary class have
but eighteen in all.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>
<p>So conversant are the natives with the structure and
“points” of the elephant, that they divide them readily
into castes, and describe with particularity their distinctive
excellences and defects. In the <i>Hastisilpe</i>, a
Singhalese work which treats of their natural management,
the marks of inferior breeding are said to be “eyes
restless like those of a crow, the hair of the head of
mixed shades; the face wrinkled; the tongue curved and
black; the nails short and green; the ears small; the
neck thin, the skin freckled; the tail without a tuft, and
the fore-quarter lean and low;” whilst the perfection of
form and beauty is supposed to consist in the “softness
of the skin, the red colour of the mouth and tongue, the
forehead expanded and hollow, the ears broad and rectangular,
the trunk broad at the root and blotched with
pink in front; the eyes bright and kindly, the cheeks
large, the neck full, the back level, the chest square, the
fore legs short and convex in front, the hind quarter
plump, and five nails on each foot, all smooth, polished,
and round.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> An elephant with these perfections,” says
the author of the <i>Hastisilpe</i>, “will impart glory and
magnificence to the king; but he cannot be discovered
amongst thousands, yea, there shall never be found an
elephant clothed at once with <i>all</i> the excellences herein
described.” The “points” of an elephant are to be
studied with the greatest advantage in those attached to
the temples, which are always of the highest caste, and
exhibit the most perfect breeding.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>
<p>The colour of the animal’s skin in a state of nature is
generally of a lighter brown than that of those in captivity;
a distinction which arises, in all probability, not
so much from the wild animal’s propensity to cover itself
with mud and dust, as from the superior care which is
taken in repeatedly bathing the tame ones, and in rubbing
their skins with a soft stone, a lump of burnt clay,
or the rough husk of a coco-nut. This kind of discipline,
together with the occasional application of oil,
gives rise to the deeper black which the hides of the
latter present.</p>

<p>Amongst the Singhalese, however, a singular preference
is evinced for elephants that exhibit those flesh-coloured
blotches which occasionally mottle the skin
of an elephant, chiefly about the head and extremities.
The front of the trunk, the tips of the ears, the forehead,
and occasionally the legs, are thus diversified with stains
of a yellowish tint, inclining to pink. These are not
natural; nor are they hereditary, for they are seldom
exhibited by the younger individuals in a herd, but appear
to be the result of some eruptive affection, the irritation
of which has induced the animal in its uneasiness
to rub itself against the rough bark of trees, and thus to
abrade the outer cuticle.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>To a European these spots appear blemishes, and the
taste that leads the natives to admire them is probably
akin to the feeling that has at all times rendered <i>a white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>elephant</i> an object of wonder to Asiatics. The rarity of
the latter is accounted for by regarding this peculiar
appearance as the result of albinism; and notwithstanding
the exaggeration of Oriental historians, who compare
the fairness of such creatures to the whiteness of snow,
even in its utmost perfection, I apprehend that the tint
of a white elephant is little else than a flesh-colour,
rendered somewhat more conspicuous by the blanching
of the skin, and the lightness of the colourless hairs with
which it is sparsely covered. A white elephant is mentioned
in the <i>Mahawanso</i> as forming part of the retinue
attached to the “Temple of the Tooth” at Anarajapoora,
in the fifth century after Christ;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> but it commanded no
religious veneration, and like those in the stud of the
kings of Siam, it was tended merely as an emblem of
royalty;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> the sovereign of Ceylon being addressed as
the “Lord of Elephants.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> At the same time it admits
of no doubt that in the early ages, white animals were in
some parts of the East the objects of devout adoration.
Herodotus alludes to the sacred white horses, ἱερῶν
ἵππων τῶν λευκῶν, which accompanied the army of Cyrus
to the siege of Babylon;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> he equally records that
amongst the Egyptians purely white oxen were sacred to
Epaphus; but one single dark hair was enough to exclude
them as unclean.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>In 1633 a white elephant was exhibited in Holland;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>but as this was some years before the Dutch had established
themselves firmly in Ceylon, it was probably
brought from some other of their eastern possessions.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />

<small><small>HABITS WHEN WILD.</small></small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> found generally in warm and sunny climates,
it is a mistake to suppose that the elephant is partial
either to heat or to light. In Ceylon, the mountain
tops, and not the sultry valleys, are its favourite resort.
In Ouvah, where the elevated plains are often crisp with
the morning frost, and on Pedura-talla-galla, at the
height of upwards of eight thousand feet, they may be
found in herds at times when the hunter will search for
them without success in the hot jungles of the low
country. No altitude, in fact, seems too lofty or too
chill for the elephant, provided it affords the luxury of
water in abundance; and, contrary to the general opinion
that the elephant delights in sunshine, it seems at all
times impatient of glare, and spends the day in the
thickest depth of the forests, devoting the night to excursions,
and to the luxury of the bath, in which it also
indulges occasionally by day. This partiality for shade is
doubtless ascribable to the animal’s love of coolness and
solitude; but it is not altogether unconnected with the
position of the eye, and the circumscribed use which its
peculiar mode of life permits it to make of the faculty
of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>All the elephant hunters and natives with whom I have
spoken on the subject, concur in opinion that its range
of vision is circumscribed, and that it relies more on the
ear and the sense of smell than on its sight, which is
liable to be obstructed by dense foliage; besides which,
from the formation of its short neck, the elephant is incapable
of directing the range of the eye much above the
level of the head.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>This small sphere of vision is sufficient to account for
the excessive caution of the elephant, its alarm at unusual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>noises, and the timidity and panic exhibited at trivial
objects and incidents which, imperfectly discerned, excite
suspicions for its safety.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> In 1841 an officer<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> was chased
by an elephant that he had slightly wounded. Seizing
him near the dry bed of a river, the animal had its forefoot
already raised to crush him; but its forehead being
touched at the same instant by the tendrils of a climbing
plant which had suspended itself from the branches
above, it suddenly turned and fled; leaving him badly
hurt, but with no limb broken. I have heard similar instances,
equally well attested, of this peculiarity in the
character of the elephant.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the power of smell is so remarkable
as almost to compensate for the deficiency of sight.
A herd is not only apprised of the approach of danger
by this means, but when scattered in the forest, and dispersed
out of range of sight, they are enabled by it to
reassemble with rapidity and to adopt precautions for
their common safety. The same necessity is met by a
delicate sense of hearing, and the use of a variety of
noises or calls, by means of which elephants succeed in
communicating with each other upon all emergencies.
“The sounds which they utter have been described by
the African hunters as of three kinds: the first, which is
very shrill, produced by blowing through the trunk, is
indicative of pleasure; the second, produced by the
mouth, is expressive of want; and the third, proceeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>from the throat, is a terrific roar of anger or revenge.”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
These words convey but an imperfect idea of the variety
of noises made by the elephant in Ceylon; and the
shrill cry produced by blowing through his trunk, so far
from being regarded as an indication of “pleasure,” is
the well-known cry of rage with which he rushes to encounter
an assailant. <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span> describes it as resembling
the hoarse sound of a “trumpet.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> The French
still designate the proboscis of an elephant by the same
expression “trompe” (which we have unmeaningly corrupted
into <i>trunk</i>), and hence the scream of the elephant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>is known as “trumpeting” by the hunters in Ceylon.
Their cry when in pain, or when subjected to compulsion,
is a grunt or a deep groan from the throat, with the proboscis
curled upwards and the lips wide apart.</p>

<p>Should the attention of an individual in the herd be
attracted by any unusual appearance in the forest, the
intelligence is rapidly communicated by a low suppressed
sound made by the lips, somewhat resembling the twittering
of a bird, and described by the hunters by the
word “<i>prut</i>.”</p>

<p>A very remarkable noise has been described to me by
more than one individual, who had come unexpectedly
upon a herd during the night, when the alarm of the elephants
was apparently too great to be satisfied with the
stealthy note of warning just described. On these occasions
the sound produced resembled the hollow booming
of an empty tun when struck with a wooden mallet or a
muffled sledge. Major <span class="smcap">Macready</span>, Military Secretary in
Ceylon in 1836, who heard it by night amongst the wild
elephants in the great forest of Bintenne, describes it as
“a sort of banging noise like that of a cooper hammering
a cask;” and Major <span class="smcap">Skinner</span> is of opinion that it
must be produced by the elephant striking his ribs rapidly
and forcibly with his trunk. Mr. <span class="smcap">Cripps</span> informs me that
he has more than once seen an elephant, when surprised
or alarmed, produce this sound by beating the ground
forcibly with the flat side of the trunk; and this movement
was instantly succeeded by raising it again, and
pointing it in the direction whence the alarm proceeded,
as if to ascertain by the sense of smell the nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
threatened danger. As this strange sound is generally
mingled with the bellowing and ordinary trumpeting of
the herd, it is in all probability a device resorted to, not
alone for warning their companions of some approaching
peril, but also for the additional purpose of terrifying
unseen intruders.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Elephants are subject to deafness; and the Singhalese
regard as the most formidable of all wild animals, a
“rogue”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> afflicted with this infirmity.</p>

<p>Extravagant estimates are recorded of the height of
the elephant. In an age when popular fallacies in relation
to him were as yet uncorrected in Europe by the
actual inspection of the living animal, he was supposed
to grow to the height of twelve or fifteen feet. Even
within the last century, in popular works on natural history,
the elephant, when full grown, was said to measure
from seventeen to twenty feet from the ground to the
shoulder.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> At a still later period, so imperfectly had
the truth been ascertained, that the elephant of Ceylon
was believed “to excel that of Africa in size and
strength.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> But so far from equalling the size of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>African species, that of Ceylon seldom exceeds the height
of nine feet; even in the Hambangtotte country, where
the hunters agree that the largest specimens are to be
found, the tallest in ordinary herds do not average
more than eight feet. <span class="smcap">Wolf</span>, in his account of the
Ceylon elephant,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> says he saw one taken near Jaffna,
which measured twelve feet and one inch high. But the
truth is, that the general bulk of the elephant so far
exceeds that of the animals we are accustomed to see
daily, that the imagination magnifies its unusual dimensions;
and I have seldom or ever met with an inexperienced
spectator who did not unconsciously overestimate
the size of an elephant shown to him, whether
in captivity or in a state of nature. Major <span class="smcap">Denham</span>
would have guessed some which he saw in Africa to be
sixteen feet in height, but the largest when killed was
found to measure nine feet six, from the foot to the hipbone.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>For a creature of such extraordinary weight it is
astonishing how noiselessly and stealthily the elephant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>can escape from a pursuer. When suddenly disturbed
in the jungle, it will burst away with a rush that seems
to bear down all before it; but the noise sinks into
absolute stillness so suddenly, that a novice might well
be led to suppose that the fugitive had only halted within
a few yards of him, when further search will disclose
that it has stolen silently away, making scarcely a sound
in its escape; and, stranger still, leaving the foliage
almost undisturbed by its passage.</p>

<p>The most venerable delusion respecting the elephant,
and that which held its ground with unequalled tenacity,
is the ancient fallacy thus set out by <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Browne</span>
in his <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>. “The elephant, it is said,
hath no joynts; and this absurdity is seconded by
another, that being unable to lye downe it sleepeth
against a tree, which the hunters observing doe saw
almost asunder, whereon the beast relying, by the fall of
the tree falls also downe it-selfe and is able to rise no
more.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> is disposed to think that “the hint
and ground of this opinion might be the grosse and
somewhat cylindricall composure of the legs of the elephant,
and the equality and lesse perceptible disposure of
the joynts, especially in the forelegs of this animal, they
appearing, when he standeth, like pillars of flesh;” but he
overlooks the fact that <span class="smcap">Pliny</span> has ascribed the same peculiarity
to the Scandinavian beast somewhat resembling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>a horse, which he calls a “machlis,”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> and that <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>
in describing the wild animals in the Hercynian forests,
enumerates the <i>alce</i> (elk?), “in colour and configuration
approaching the goat, but surpassing it in size, its
head destitute of horns <i>and its limbs of joints</i>, whence
it can neither lie down to rest, nor rise if by any accident
it should fall, but using the trees for a resting-place,
the hunters by loosening their roots bring the <i>alce</i> to the
ground, so soon as it is tempted to lean on them.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
This fallacy, as Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Browne</span><a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> says, is “not the
daughter of latter times, but an old and grey-headed
errour, even in the days of <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>,” who deals with
the story as he received it from <span class="smcap">Ctesias</span>, by whom it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>appears to have been embodied in his lost work on India.
But although <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span> generally receives the credit of
having exposed and demolished the fallacy of <span class="smcap">Ctesias</span>,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> it
will be seen by a reference to his treatise <i>On the Progressive
Motions of Animals</i>, that in reality he approached
the question with some hesitation, and has not only left
it doubtful in one passage whether the elephant has
joints in his knee, although he demonstrates that it has
joints in the shoulders;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> but in another he distinctly
affirms that on account of his weight the elephant cannot
bend his forelegs together, but only one at a time, and
reclines to sleep on that particular side.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>So great was the authority of <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, that <span class="smcap">Ælian</span>,
who wrote two centuries later and borrowed many of his
statements from the works of his predecessor, perpetuates
this error; and, after describing the exploits of the
trained elephants exhibited at Rome, adds the expression
of his surprise, that an animal without joints (ἄναρθρον)
should yet be able to dance.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> The fiction was too
agreeable to be readily abandoned by the poets of the
Lower Empire and the Romancers of the middle ages;
and <span class="smcap">Phile</span>, a contemporary of <span class="smcap">Petrarch</span> and <span class="smcap">Dante</span>,
who in the early part of the fourteenth century addressed
his didactic poem on the elephant to the emperor Andronicus
II., untaught by the exposition of <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, still
clung to the old delusion,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solinus</span> introduced the same fable into his <i>Polyhistor</i>;
and <span class="smcap">Dicuil</span>, the Irish commentator of the ninth century,
who had an opportunity of seeing the elephant sent by
Haroun Alraschid as a present to Charlemagne<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> in the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>It is a strong illustration of the vitality of error, that
the delusion thus exposed by Dicuil in the ninth century,
was revived by <span class="smcap">Matthew Paris</span> in the thirteenth; and
stranger still, that Matthew not only saw but made a
drawing of the elephant presented to King Henry III.
by the King of France in 1255, in which he nevertheless
represents the legs as without joints.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>In the numerous mediæval treatises on natural history,
known under the title of <i>Bestiaries</i>, this delusion regarding
the elephant is often repeated; and it is given
at length in a metrical version of the <i>Physiologus</i> of

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Browne</span>, while he argues against the
delusion, does not fail to record his suspicion, that
“although the opinion at present be reasonably well
suppressed, yet from the strings of tradition and fruitful
recurrence of errour, it was not improbable it might
revive in the next generation;”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>—an anticipation which
has proved singularly correct; for the heralds still continued

</div></div></div>

<p>It is not difficult to discern whence this antiquated
delusion took its origin; nor is it, as Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Browne</span>
imagined, to be traced exclusively “to the grosse and
cylindricall structure” of the animal’s legs. The fact is,
that the elephant, returning in the early morning from
his nocturnal revels in the reservoirs and watercourses,
is accustomed to rub his muddy sides against a tree, and
sometimes against a rock if more convenient. Often in
my rides at sunrise through the northern forests, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>natives of Ceylon have pointed out that the elephants
which had preceded me must have been of considerable
size, judging from the height at which their
marks had been left on the trees against which they had
recently been rubbing. Not unfrequently the animals
themselves, overcome with drowsiness from the night’s
gambolling, are found dozing and resting against the
trees they had so visited, and in the same manner they
have been discovered by sportsmen asleep, and leaning
against a rock.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to explain that the position
is accidental, and that it is taken by the elephant not
from any difficulty in lying at length on the ground, but
rather from the coincidence that the structure of his legs
affords such support in a standing position, that reclining
scarcely adds to his enjoyment of repose; and elephants
in a state of captivity have been known for months
together to sleep without lying down.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> So distinctive is
this formation, and so self-sustaining the configuration of
the limbs, that an elephant shot in the brain, by Major
Rogers in 1836, was killed so instantaneously that it
died literally <i>on its knees</i>, and remained resting on them.
About the year 1826, Captain Dawson, the engineer of
the great road to Kandy, over the Kaduganava pass,
shot an elephant at Hangwelle on the banks of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>Kalany Ganga; <i>it remained on its feet</i>, but so motionless,
that after discharging a few more balls, he was induced
to go close to it, and found it dead.</p>

<p>The real peculiarity in the elephant in lying down is,
that he extends his hind legs backwards as a man does
when he kneels, instead of bringing them under him
like the horse or any other quadruped. The wise purpose
of this arrangement must be obvious to any one
who observes the struggle with which the horse <i>gets up</i>
from the ground, and the violent efforts which he makes
to raise himself erect. Such an exertion in the case of
the elephant, and the force requisite to apply a similar
movement to raise his weight (equal to four or five tons)
would be attended with a dangerous strain upon the
muscles, and hence the simple arrangement, which by
enabling him to draw the hind feet gradually under him,
assists him to rise without a perceptible effort.</p>

<p>From the same causes I am disposed to think that the
elephant is too weighty and unwieldy to leap, at least to
any considerable height or distance; and yet I have
seen in the <i>Colombo Observer</i> for March, 1866, an interesting
account of a corral, written by an able and
accurate describer, in which it is stated that an enfuriated
tusker, the property of the Government, made a rush to
escape from the enclosure, “and fairly leaped the
barrier, of some fifteen feet high, only carrying away the
top cross beam with a great crash.”</p>

<p>The same construction renders his gait not a “gallop,”
as it has been somewhat loosely described,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> which would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>be too violent a motion for so vast a body; but a shuffle,
that he can increase at pleasure to a pace as rapid as
that of a man at full speed, but which he cannot maintain
for any considerable distance.</p>

<p>It is to the structure of the knee-joint that the elephant
is indebted for his singular facility in ascending and descending
steep acclivities, climbing rocks and traversing
precipitous ledges, where even a mule dare not venture;
and this again leads to the correction of another generally
received error, that his legs are “formed more for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>strength than flexibility, and fitted to bear an enormous
weight upon a level surface, without the necessity of
ascending or descending great acclivities.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> The same
authority assumes that, although the elephant is found
in the neighbourhood of mountainous ranges, and will
even ascend rocky passes, such a service is a violation of
its natural habits.</p>

<p>Of the elephant of Africa I am not qualified to speak,
nor of the nature of the ground which it most frequents;
but certainly the facts in connection with the elephant
of India are all irreconcilable with the theory mentioned
above. In Bengal, in the Nilgherries, in Nepal, in
Burmah, in Siam, Sumatra, and Ceylon, the districts in
which the elephants most abound, are all hilly and
mountainous. In the latter, especially, there is not a
range so elevated as to be inaccessible to them. On
the very summit of Adam’s Peak, at an altitude of 7,420
feet, and on a pinnacle which the pilgrims climb with
difficulty, by means of steps hewn in the rock, Major
Skinner, in 1840, found the spoor of an elephant.</p>

<p>Prior to 1840, and before coffee-plantations had been
extensively opened in the Kandyan ranges, there was
not a mountain or a lofty feature of land of Ceylon which
they had not traversed, in their periodical migrations in
search of water; and the sagacity which they display in
“laying out roads” is almost incredible. They generally
keep along the <i>backbone</i> of a chain of hills, avoiding
steep gradients: and one curious observation was not
lost upon the Government surveyors, that in crossing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>valleys from ridge to ridge, through forests so dense as
to obstruct a distant view, the elephants invariably select
the line of march which communicates most judiciously
with the opposite point, by means of the safest ford.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
So sure-footed are they, that there are few places where
man can go that an elephant cannot follow, provided
there be space to admit his bulk, and solidity to sustain
his weight.</p>

<p>In 1865 a capture of elephants was attempted at
Avisavelle in Ceylon: the corral was constructed close
to a wall of rocks so precipitous and high that it was
considered superfluous to continue the enclosure in front
of them. But over these rocks the elephants made their
escape, and the corral was a total failure.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>This faculty is almost entirely derived from the unusual
position, as compared with other quadrupeds, of
the knee joint of the hind leg; arising from the superior
length of the thigh bone, and the shortness of the metatarsus:
the heel being almost where it projects in man,
instead of being lifted up as a “hock.” It is this which
enables him, in descending declivities, to depress and
adjust the weight of his hinder portions, which would
otherwise overbalance and force him headlong.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>by the same arrangement that he is enabled, on uneven
ground, to lift his feet, which are tender and sensitive,
with delicacy, and plant them with such decision as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>ensure his own safety as well as that of objects which it
is expedient to avoid touching.</p>

<p>A <i>herd</i> of elephants is a family, not a group whom
accident or attachment may have induced to associate
together. Similarity of features and caste attest that,
among the various individuals which compose it, there
is a common lineage and relationship. In a herd of
twenty-one elephants, captured in 1844, the trunks of
each individual presented the same peculiar formation,—long,
and almost of one uniform breadth throughout,
instead of tapering gradually from the root to the nostril.
In another instance, the eyes of thirty-five taken in one
corral were of the same colour in each. The same slope
of the back, the same form of the forehead, is to be detected
in the majority of the same group.</p>

<p>In the forest several herds sometimes browse in
close contiguity, and in their expeditions in search of
water they may form a body of possibly one or two
hundred; but on the slightest disturbance each distinct
herd hastens to re-form within its own particular circle,
and to take measures on its own behalf for retreat or
defence.</p>

<p>The natives of any place which may chance to be frequented
by elephants, observe that the numbers of the
same herd fluctuate very slightly; and hunters in pursuit
of them, who may chance to have shot one or more,
always reckon with certainty the precise number of
those remaining, although a considerable interval may
intervene before they again encounter them. The proportion
of males is generally small, and some herds have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
been seen composed exclusively of females; possibly in
consequence of the males having been shot. A herd
usually consists of from ten to twenty individuals, though
occasionally they exceed the latter number; and in
their frequent migrations and nightly resort to tanks
and water-courses, alliances are formed between members
of associated herds, which serve to introduce new
blood into the family.</p>

<p>In illustration of the attachment of the elephant to
its young, the authority of <span class="smcap">Knox</span> has been quoted, that
“the shees are alike tender of anyone’s young ones as
of their own.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> Their affection in this particular is
undoubted, but I question whether it exceeds that of
other animals; and the trait thus adduced of their
indiscriminate kindness to all the young of the herd,—of
which I have myself been an eye-witness,—so far
from being an evidence of the intensity of parental
attachment individually, is, perhaps, somewhat inconsistent
with the existence of such a passion to any
extraordinary degree.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> In fact, some individuals, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>have had extensive facilities for observation, doubt
whether the fondness of the female elephants for their
offspring is so great as that of many other animals; as
instances are not wanting in Ceylon, in which, when
pursued by the hunters, the herd has abandoned the
young ones in their flight, notwithstanding the cries of
the latter for protection.</p>

<p>In an interesting paper on the habits of the Indian
elephant, published in the <i>Philosophical Transactions for
1793</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Corse</span> says: “If a wild elephant happens
to be separated from its young for only two days,
though giving suck, she never after recognises or acknowledges
it,” although the young one evidently knows its
dam, and by its plaintive cries and submissive approaches
solicits her assistance.</p>

<p>If by any accident an elephant becomes hopelessly
separated from his own herd, he is not permitted to
attach himself to any other. He may browse in their
vicinity, or resort to the same places to drink and to
bathe; but the intercourse is only on a distant and conventional
footing, and no familiarity or intimate association
is under any circumstances permitted. To such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>a height is this exclusiveness carried, that even amidst
the terror and stupefaction of an elephant corral, when
an individual, detached from his own party in the <i>mêlée</i>
and confusion, has been driven into the enclosure along
with an unbroken herd, I have seen him repulsed in every
attempt to take refuge among them, and driven off by
heavy blows with their trunks as often as he attempted
to insinuate himself within the circle which they had
formed for their own security. There can be no reasonable
doubt that this jealous and exclusive policy not
only contributes to produce, but mainly serves to perpetuate,
the class of solitary elephants which are known
by the term <i>goondahs</i>, in India, and which from their
vicious propensities and predatory habits are called <i>Hora</i>,
or <i>Rogues</i>, in Ceylon.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>It is believed by the Singhalese that these are either
individuals, who by accident have lost their former associates
and become morose and savage from rage and
solitude; or else that being naturally vicious they have
become daring from the yielding habits of their milder
companions, and eventually separated themselves from
the rest of the herd which had refused to associate with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>them. Another conjecture is, that being almost universally
males, the death or capture of particular females
may have detached them from their former companions
in search of fresh alliances.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> It is also believed that a
tame elephant escaping from activity, unable to rejoin
its former herd, and excluded from any other, becomes
a “<i>rogue</i>” from necessity. In Ceylon it is generally
believed that the <i>rogues</i> are all males (but of this I am
not certain), and so sullen is their disposition that
although two may be in the same vicinity, there is no
known instance of two <i>rogues</i> associating, or of a <i>rogue</i>
being seen in company with another elephant.</p>

<p>They spend their nights in marauding, often around
the dwellings of men, destroying plantations, trampling
down gardens, and committing serious ravages in rice
grounds and young coco-nut plantations. Hence from
their closer contact with man and his dwellings, these
outcasts become disabused of many of the terrors which
render the ordinary elephant timid and needlessly
cautious; they break through fences without fear; and
even in the daylight a <i>rogue</i> has been known near Ambogammoa
to watch a field of labourers at work in reaping
rice, and boldly to walk in amongst them, seize a sheaf
from the heap, and retire with it leisurely to the jungle.
By day they generally seek concealment, but are fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>quently
to be met with prowling about the by-roads and
jungle paths, where travellers are exposed to the utmost
risk from their assaults. It is probable that this hostility
to man is the result of the enmity engendered by measures
which the natives, who have a constant dread of
their visits, adopt for the protection of the growing crops.
In some districts, especially in the low country of Badulla,
the villagers occasionally enclose their cottages
with rude walls of earth and branches to protect them
from nightly assaults. In places infested by them, the
visits of European sportsmen to the vicinity of their
haunts are eagerly encouraged by the natives, who think
themselves happy in lending their services to track the
herds in consideration of the benefit conferred on the
village communities by the destruction of a rogue. In
1847 one of these formidable creatures frequented for
some months the Rangbodde Pass on the great mountain
road leading to the sanatarium, at Neuera-ellia; and
amongst other excesses, killed a Caffre belonging to the
corps of Caffre pioneers, by seizing him with its trunk
and beating him to death against the bank.</p>

<p>To return to the herd: one member of it, usually
the largest and most powerful, is by common consent
implicitly followed as leader. A tusker, if there be one
in the party, is generally observed to be the commander;
but a female, if of superior energy, is as readily obeyed
as a male. In fact, in this promotion there is no
reason to doubt that supremacy is almost unconsciously
assumed by those endowed with superior vigour and
courage rather than from the accidental possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
greater bodily strength; and the devotion and loyalty
which the herd evince to their leader are very remarkable.
This is more readily seen in the case of a
tusker than any other, because in a herd he is generally
the object of the keenest pursuit by the hunters. On
such occasions the others do their utmost to protect him
from danger: when driven to extremity they place their
leader in the centre and crowd so eagerly in front of
him that the sportsmen have to shoot a number which
they might otherwise have spared. In one instance a
tusker, which was badly wounded by Major <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>,
was promptly surrounded by his companions, who supported
him between their shoulders, and actually succeeded
in covering his retreat to the forest.</p>

<p>Those who have lived much in the jungle in Ceylon,
and had constant opportunities of watching the habits
of wild elephants, have witnessed instances of the submission
of herds to their leaders, that suggest an inquiry
of singular interest as to the means adopted by the latter
to communicate with distinctness, orders which are
observed with the most implicit obedience by their
followers. The following narrative of an adventure in
the great central forest toward the north of the island,
communicated to me by Major <span class="smcap">Skinner</span>, who was
engaged for some time in surveying and opening roads
through the thickly-wooded districts there, will serve
better than any abstract description to convey an idea of
the conduct of a herd on such occasions:—</p>

<p>“The case you refer to struck me as exhibiting something
more than ordinary brute instinct, and approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
nearer to reasoning powers than any other instance I can
now remember. I cannot do justice to the scene, although
it appeared to me at the time to be so remarkable that it
left a deep impression in my mind.</p>

<p>“In the height of the dry season in Neuera-Kalawa,
you know the streams are all dried up, and the tanks
nearly so. All animals are then sorely pressed for water,
and they congregate in the vicinity of those tanks in
which there may remain ever so little of the precious
element.</p>

<p>“During one of those seasons I was encamped on the
bund or embankment of a very small tank, the water in
which was so dried that its surface could not have
exceeded an area of 500 square yards. It was the only
pond within many miles, and I knew that of necessity
a very large herd of elephants, which had been in the
neighbourhood all day, must resort to it at night.</p>

<p>“On the lower side of the tank, and in a line with the
embankment, was a thick forest, in which the elephants
sheltered themselves during the day. On the upper side
and all around the tank there was a considerable margin
of open ground. It was one of those beautiful bright,
clear, moonlight nights, when objects could be seen almost
as distinctly as by day, and I determined to avail myself
of the opportunity to observe the movements of the herd,
which had already manifested some uneasiness at our
presence. The locality was very favourable for my purpose,
and an enormous tree projecting over the tank
afforded me a secure lodgement in its branches. Having
ordered the fires of my camp to be extinguished at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
early hour, and all my followers to retire to rest, I took
up my post of observation on the overhanging bough;
but I had to remain for upwards of two hours before anything
was to be seen or heard of the elephants, although
I knew they were within 500 yards of me. At length,
about the distance of 300 yards from the water, an
unusually large elephant issued from the dense cover,
and advanced cautiously across the open ground to within
100 yards of the tank, where he stood perfectly motionless.
So quiet had the elephants become (although they
had been roaring and breaking the jungle throughout
the day and evening), that not a movement was now to
be heard. The huge vidette remained in his position,
still as a rock, for a few minutes, and then made three
successive stealthy advances of several yards (halting for
some minutes between each, with ears bent forward to
catch the slightest sound), and in this way he moved
slowly up to the water’s edge. Still he did not venture
to quench his thirst, for though his fore feet were partially
in the tank and his vast body was reflected clear in the
water, he remained for some minutes listening in perfect
stillness. Not a motion could be perceived in himself or
his shadow. He returned cautiously and slowly to the
position he had at first taken up on emerging from the
forest. Here in a little while he was joined by five
others, with which he again proceeded as cautiously, but
less slowly than before, to within a few yards of the
tank, and then posted his patrols. He then re-entered
the forest and collected around him the whole herd,
which must have amounted to between 80 and 100<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
individuals,—led them across the open ground with the
most extraordinary composure and quietness, till he
joined the advanced guard, when he left them for a
moment and repeated his former reconnoissance at the
edge of the tank. After which, having apparently
satisfied himself that all was safe, he returned and
obviously gave the order to advance, for in a moment
the whole herd rushed into the water with a degree of
unreserved confidence, so opposite to the caution and
timidity which had marked their previous movements,
that nothing will ever persuade me that there was not
rational and preconcerted co-operation throughout the
whole party, and a degree of responsible authority exercised
by the patriarch leader.</p>

<p>“When the poor animals had gained possession of the
tank (the leader being the last to enter), they seemed
to abandon themselves to enjoyment without restraint
or apprehension of danger. Such a mass of animal life
I had never before seen huddled together in so narrow
a space. It seemed to me as though they would have
nearly drunk the tank dry. I watched them with great
interest until they had satisfied themselves as well in
bathing as in drinking, when I tried how small a noise
would apprise them of the proximity of unwelcome
neighbours. I had but to break a little twig, and the
solid mass instantly took to flight like a herd of frightened
deer, each of the smaller calves being apparently
shouldered and carried along between two of the older
ones.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p055.jpg" width="500" height="149" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In drinking, the elephant, like the camel, although
preferring water pure, shows no decided aversion to it
when discoloured with mud;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> and the eagerness with
which he precipitates himself into the tanks and streams
attests his exquisite enjoyment of the fresh coolness,
which to him is the chief attraction. In crossing deep
rivers, although his rotundity and buoyancy enable him
to swim with a less immersion than other quadrupeds,
he generally prefers to sink till no part of his huge body
is visible except the tip of his trunk, through which he
breathes, moving beneath the surface, and only now and
then raising his head to look that he is keeping the
proper direction.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> In the dry season the scanty streams
which, during the rains, are sufficient to convert the
rivers of the low country into torrents, often entirely
disappear, leaving only broad expanses of dry sand,
which they have swept down with them from the hills.
In this the elephants contrive to sink wells for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>own use by scooping out the sand to the depth of four
or five feet, and leaving a hollow for the percolation of
the spring. But as the weight of the elephant would
force in the side if left perpendicular, one approach is
always formed with such a gradient that he can reach
the water with his trunk without disturbing the surrounding
sand.</p>

<p>I have reason to believe, although the fact has not been
authoritatively stated by naturalists, that the stomach of
the elephant will be found to include a chamber analogous
to that possessed by some of the ruminants, calculated
to contain a supply of water as a provision against
emergencies. The fact of his being enabled to retain a
quantity of water and discharge it at pleasure has been
long known to every observer of the habits of the
animal; but the proboscis has always been supposed to
be “his water-reservoir,”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and the theory of an internal
receptacle has not been discussed. The truth is that the
anatomy of the elephant is even yet but imperfectly
understood,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> and, although some peculiarities of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>stomach were observed at an early period by <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>
and others;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> and even their configuration described, the
function of the abnormal portion remained undetermined,
and has been only recently conjectured. An elephant
which belonged to Louis XIV. died at Versailles in
1681 at the age of seventeen, and an account of its dissection
was published in the <i>Mémoires pour servir à
l’Histoire Naturelle</i>, under the authority of the Academy
of Sciences, in which the unusual appendages of the
stomach are pointed out with sufficient particularity, but
no suggestion is made as to their probable uses.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for December 1850,
says that “<span class="smcap">Camper</span> and other comparative anatomists
have shown that the left, or cardiac end of the stomach
in the elephant is adapted, by several wide folds of lining
membrane, to serve as a receiver for water;” but this is
scarcely correct, for although <span class="smcap">Camper</span> has accurately
figured the external form of the stomach, he disposes
of the question of the interior functions with the simple
remark that its folds “semblent en faire une espèce de
division particulière.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> In like manner Sir <span class="smcap">Everard
Home</span>, in his <i>Lectures on Comparative Anatomy</i>, has
not only carefully described the form of the elephant’s
stomach, and furnished a drawing of it even more
accurate than <span class="smcap">Camper</span>; but he has equally failed to
assign any purpose for so strange a formation; contenting
himself with observing that the structure is a
peculiarity, and that one of the remarkable folds nearest
the orifice of the diaphragm appears to act as a valve, so
that the portion beyond may be considered as an appendage
similar to that of the hog and the <i>peccary</i>.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i_p059.jpg" width="400" height="263" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ELEPHANT’S STOMACH.</div>
</div>

<p>The appendage thus alluded to by Sir <span class="smcap">Everard Home</span>
is the “grand cul-de-sac,” noticed by the Académie des
Sciences, and the “division particulière,” figured by
<span class="smcap">Camper</span>. It is of sufficient dimensions to contain ten
gallons of water, and by means of the valve above
alluded to, it can be shut off from the chamber devoted
to the process of digestion. Professor <span class="smcap">Owen</span> is probably
the first who, not from an autopsy, but from the mere
inspection of the drawings of <span class="smcap">Camper</span> and <span class="smcap">Home</span>,
ventured to assert (in lectures hitherto unpublished),
that the uses of this section of the elephant’s stomach
may be analogous to those ascertained to belong to a
somewhat similar arrangement in the stomach of the
camel, one cavity of which is exclusively employed as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>reservoir for water, and performs no function in the preparation
of food.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p060.jpg" width="500" height="378" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Whilst Professor <span class="smcap">Owen</span> was advancing this conjecture,
another comparative anatomist, from the examination of
another portion of the structure of the elephant, was led
to a somewhat similar conclusion. Dr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span> of
Dublin had, in 1847, an opportunity of dissecting the
body of an elephant which had suddenly died; and in
the course of his examination of the thoracic viscera
he observed that an unusually close connection existed
between the trachea and œsophagus, which he found to
depend on a muscle unnoticed by any previous anatomist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>connecting the back of the former with the fore part of
the latter, along which the fibres descend and can be
distinctly traced to the cardiac orifice of the stomach.
Imperfectly acquainted with the habits and functions of
the elephant in a state of nature, Dr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span> found
it difficult to pronounce as to the use of this very peculiar
structure; but looking to the intimate connection
between the mechanism concerned in the functions of
respiration and deglutition, and seeing that the proboscis
served in a double capacity as an instrument of voice
and an organ for the prehension of food, he ventured
(apparently without adverting to the abnormal form of
the stomach) to express the opinion that this muscle,
viewing its attachment to the trachea, might either have
some influence in raising the diaphragm, and thereby
assisting in expiration, “<i>or that it might raise the cardiac
orifice of the stomach, and so aid this organ to regurgitate a
portion of its contents into the œsophagus</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>, on the reflection that “we have no
satisfactory evidence that the animal ever ruminates,”
thought it useless to speculate on the latter supposition
as to the action of the newly discovered muscle, and
rather inclined to the surmise that it was designed to
assist the elephant in producing the remarkable sound
through his proboscis known as “trumpeting;” but there
is little room to doubt that of the two the rejected hypothesis
was the more correct one. I have elsewhere
described the occurrence to which I was myself a witness,
of elephants inserting their proboscis in their mouths,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>and withdrawing gallons of water, which could only have
been contained in the receptacle figured by <span class="smcap">Camper</span> and
<span class="smcap">Home</span>, and of which the true uses were discerned by the
clear intellect of Professor <span class="smcap">Owen</span>. I was not, till very
recently, aware that a similar observation as to this remarkable
habit of the elephant, had been made by the
author of the <i>Ayeen Akbery</i>, in his account of the <i>Feel
Kaneh</i>, or elephant stables of the Emperor Akbar, in
which he says, “an elephant frequently with his trunk
takes water out of his stomach and sprinkles himself
with it, and it is not in the least offensive.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> <span class="smcap">Forbes</span>, in
his Oriental Memoirs, quotes this passage of the <i>Ayeen
Akbery</i>, but without a remark; nor does any European
writer with whose works I am acquainted appear to have
been cognisant of the peculiarity in question.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_p062.jpg" width="350" height="266" alt="" />
<div class="caption">WATER-CELLS IN THE STOMACH OF THE CAMEL.</div>
</div>

<p>It is to be hoped that Professor <span class="smcap">Owen’s</span> dissection of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>the young elephant, recently arrived, may serve to decide
this highly interesting point.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Should scientific investigation
hereafter more clearly establish the fact that,
in this particular, the structure of the elephant is assimilated
to that of the llama and the camel, it will be
regarded as more than a mere coincidence, that an apparatus,
so unique in its purpose and action, should have
been conferred by the Creator on the three animals which
in sultry climates are, by this arrangement, enabled to
traverse arid regions in the service of man.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> To show
this peculiar organisation where it attains its fullest development,
I have given a sketch of the water-cells in the
stomach of the camel on the preceding page.</p>

<p>The <i>food</i> of the elephant is so abundant, that in eating
he never appears to be impatient or voracious, but rather
to play with the leaves and branches on which he
leisurely feeds. In riding by places where a herd has
recently halted, I have sometimes seen the bark peeled
curiously off the twigs, as though it had been done in
mere dalliance. In the same way in eating grass the
elephant selects a tussac which he draws from the ground
by a dexterous twist of his trunk, and nothing can be
more graceful than the ease with which, before conveying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>it to his mouth, he beats the earth from its roots by
striking it gently upon his fore-leg. A coco-nut he first
rolls under foot, to detach the strong outer bark, then
stripping off with his trunk the thick layer of fibre within,
he places the shell in his mouth, and swallows with evident
relish the fresh liquid which flows as he crushes it
between his grinders.</p>

<p>The natives of the peninsula of Jaffna always look for
the periodical appearance of the elephants, at the precise
time when the fruit of the palmyra palm begins to fall to
the ground from ripeness. In like manner in the eastern
provinces where the custom prevails of cultivating what is
called <i>chena</i><a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> land (by clearing a patch of forest for the
purpose of raising a single crop, after which the ground is
abandoned, and reverts to jungle again), although a single
elephant may not have been seen in the neighbourhood
during the early stages of the process, the Moormen, who
are the principal cultivators of this class, will predict their
appearance with almost unerring confidence so soon as
the grains shall have begun to ripen; and although the
crop comes to maturity at different periods in different
districts, herds are certain to be seen at each in succession,
as soon as it is ready to be cut. In these well-timed
excursions they resemble the bison of North America,
which, by a similarly mysterious instinct, finds its way to
portions of the distant prairies, where accidental fires have
been followed by a growth of tender grass. In Ceylon,
although the fences around these <i>chenas</i> are little more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>than lines of reeds loosely fastened together, they are
sufficient, with the presence of a single watcher, to prevent
the entrance of the elephants, who wait patiently till
the rice and <i>coracan</i> have been removed, and the watcher
withdrawn; and, then finding gaps in the fence, they may
be seen gleaning among the leavings and the stubble;
and they take their departure when these are exhausted,
apparently in the direction of some other <i>chena</i>, which
they have ascertained to be about to be cut.</p>

<p>There is something still unexplained in the dread which
an elephant always exhibits on approaching a fence, and
the reluctance which he displays to face the slightest
artificial obstruction to his passage. In the area of the
fine old tank of Tissa-weva, close by Anarajapoora, the
natives cultivate grain, during the dry season, around the
margin where the ground has been left bare by the subsidence
of the water. These little patches of rice they
enclose with small sticks an inch in diameter and five or
six feet in height, such as would scarcely serve to keep
out a wild hog if he attempted to force his way through.
Passages of from ten to twenty feet wide are left between
each field, to permit the wild elephants, which abound in
the vicinity, to make their nocturnal visits to the water
still remaining in the centre of the tank. Night after
night these open pathways are frequented by herds, but
the tempting corn is never touched, nor is a single fence
disturbed, although the merest movement of a trunk
would be sufficient to demolish the fragile obstruction.
Yet the same spots, the fences being left open as
soon as the grain has been cut and carried home, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
eagerly entered by the elephants to glean amongst the
stubble.</p>

<p>Sportsmen observe that an elephant, even when enraged
by a wound, will hesitate to charge an assailant
across an intervening hedge, but will hurry along it to
seek for an opening. It is possible that, on the part of
the elephant, there may be some instinctive consciousness,
that owing to his superior bulk, he is exposed to
danger from sources that might be perfectly harmless in
the case of lighter animals, and hence his suspicion that
every fence may conceal a snare or pitfall. Some similar
apprehension is apparent in the deer, which shrinks
from attempting a fence of wire, although it will clear
without hesitation a solid wall of greater height.</p>

<p>At the same time, the caution with which the elephant
is supposed to approach insecure ground and places of
doubtful<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> solidity, appears to me, so far as my own observation
and experience extend, to be exaggerated, and
the number of temporary bridges which are annually
broken down by elephants in all parts of Ceylon, is
sufficient to show that, although in captivity, and when
familiar with such structures, the tame ones may, and
doubtless do, exhibit all the wariness attributed to them;
yet, in a state of liberty, and whilst unaccustomed to
such artificial appliances, their instincts are not sufficient
to ensure their safety. Besides, the fact is adverted to
elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> that the chiefs of the Wanny, during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>sovereignty of the Dutch, were accustomed to take in
pitfalls the elephants which they rendered as tribute to
Government.</p>

<p>A fact illustrative at once of the caution and the spirit
of curiosity with which an elephant regards an unaccustomed
object has been frequently mentioned to me by
the officers engaged in opening roads through the forest.
On such occasions the wooden “tracing pegs” which
they drive into the ground to mark the levels taken
during the day, will often be withdrawn by the elephants
during the night, to such an extent as frequently to render
it necessary to go over the work a second time, in order
to replace them.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Hardy</span>, formerly Deputy Quarter-Master-General
in Ceylon, when proceeding, about the year
1820, to a military out-post in the south-east of the island,
imprudently landed in an uninhabited part of the coast,
intending to take a short cut through the forest, to his
destination. He both miscalculated distance and time,
and, on the approach of nightfall, he was chased by a
vicious rogue elephant. The pursuer was close upon
him, when, to gain time, he flung down a dressing-case,
which he happened to be carrying. The device was
successful; the elephant halted, broke it open, and
minutely examined its contents, and thus gave the
colonel time to effect his escape.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the general sagacity of the elephant, although
it has not been over-rated in the instances of
those whose powers have been largely developed in
captivity, an undue estimate has been formed in relation
to them whilst still untamed. The difference of
instincts and habits renders it difficult to institute a just
comparison between them and other animals. <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span><a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
is disposed to ascribe the exalted idea that prevails of
their intellect to the feats which an elephant performs
with that unique instrument, its trunk, combined with
an imposing expression of countenance: but he records
his own conviction that in sagacity it in no way excels
the dog, and some other species of Carnivora. If there
be a superiority, I am disposed to award it to the dog,
not from any excess of natural capacity, but from the
higher degree of development consequent on his more
intimate domestication and association with man. <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span>
has remarked that “the ant and the bee seem to
come nearer to man in understanding, and in the faculty
of adapting means to proximate ends.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>One remarkable fact was called to my attention by a
gentleman who resided on a coffee plantation at Rassawé,
one of the loftiest mountains of the Ambogammoa range.
More than once during the terrific thunder-bursts that
precede the rains at the change of each monsoon, he ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>served
that the elephants in the adjoining forest hastened
from under cover of the trees and took up their station
in the open ground, where I saw them on one of these
occasions collected into a group; and here, he said, it
was their custom to remain till the lightning had ceased,
when they retired again into the jungle.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> It must be
observed, however, that showers, and especially light
drizzling rain, are believed to bring the elephants from
the jungle towards pathways or other openings in the
forest;—and hence, in places infested by them, timid
persons are afraid to travel in the afternoon during
uncertain weather.</p>

<p>When free in its native woods the elephant evinces
rather simplicity than sagacity, and its intelligence
seldom exhibits itself in cunning. The rich profusion in
which nature has supplied its food, and anticipated its
every want, has made it independent of those devices
by which carnivorous animals provide for their subsistence;
and, from the absence of all rivalry between
it and the other denizens of the plains, it is never
required to resort to artifice for self-protection. For
these reasons, in its tranquil and harmless life, it may
appear to casual observers to exhibit even less than
ordinary ability; but when danger and apprehension call
for the exertion of its powers, those who have witnessed
their display are seldom inclined to undervalue its sagacity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cripps</span> has related to me an instance in which a
recently captured elephant was either rendered senseless
from fear, or, as the native attendants asserted, <i>feigned
death</i> in order to regain its freedom. It was led from
the corral as usual between two tame ones, and had
already proceeded far towards its destination; when,
night closing in, and the torches being lighted, it refused
to go on, and finally sank to the ground, apparently
lifeless. Mr. <span class="smcap">Cripps</span> ordered the fastenings to be
removed from its legs, and when all attempts to raise it
had failed, so convinced was he that it was dead, that
he ordered the ropes to be taken off and the carcase
abandoned. While this was being done he and a
gentleman by whom he was accompanied leaned against
the body to rest. They had scarcely taken their departure
and proceeded a few yards, when, to their
astonishment, the elephant rose with the utmost alacrity,
and fled towards the jungle, screaming at the top of its
voice, its cries being audible long after it had disappeared
in the shades of the forest.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX TO CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<small><small>NARRATIVES OF THE NATIVES OF CEYLON RELATIVE
TO ENCOUNTERS WITH ROGUE ELEPHANTS.</small></small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following narratives have been taken down by a
Singhalese gentleman, from the statements of the natives
by whom they are recounted;—and they are here inserted,
in order to show the opinion prevalent amongst the people
of Ceylon as to the habits and propensities of the rogue
elephant. The stories are given in words of my correspondent,
who writes in English, as follows:—</p>

<p>1. “We,” said my informant, who was a native trader of
Caltura, “were on our way to Badulla, by way of Ratnapoora
and Balangodde, to barter our merchandise for coffee.
There were six in our party, myself, my brother-in-law, and
four coolies, who carried on pingoes<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> our merchandise,
which consisted of cloth and brass articles. About
4 o’clock, <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, we were close to Idalgasinna, and our
coolies were rather unwilling to go further for fear of
elephants, which they said were sure to be met with at that
noted place, especially as there had been a slight drizzling
of rain during the whole afternoon. I was as much afraid
of elephants as the coolies themselves; but I was anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>to proceed, and so, after a few words of encouragement
addressed to them, and a prayer or two offered up to <i>Saman
dewiyo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> resumed our journey. I also took the further
precaution of hanging up a few leaves.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> As the rain was
coming down fast and thick, and I was anxious to get to
our halting-place before night, we moved on at a rapid pace.
My brother-in-law was in the van of the party, I myself
was in the rear, and the four coolies between us, all moving
along on a rugged, rocky, and difficult path; as the road to
Badulla till lately was on the sloping side of a hill, covered
with jungle, pieces of projecting rock, and brushwood. It was
about five o’clock in the evening, or a little later, and we
had hardly cleared the foot of the hill and got to the plain
below, when a rustling of leaves and a crackling of dry
brushwood were heard on our right, followed immediately by
the trumpeting of a <i>hora allia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> which was making towards
us. We all fled, followed by the elephant. I, who was in
the rear of the party, was the first to take to flight; the
coolies threw away their pingoes, and my brother-in-law his
umbrella, and all ran in different directions. I hid myself
behind a large boulder of granite nearly covered by jungle:
but as my place of concealment was on high ground, I
could see all that was going on below. The first thing I
observed was the elephant returning to the place where one
of the pingoes was lying: he was carrying one of the
coolies in a coil of his trunk. The body of the man was
dangling with the head downward. I cannot say whether
he was then alive or not; I could not perceive any marks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>blood or bruises on his person: but he appeared to be lifeless.
The elephant placed him down on the ground, put the
pingo on his (the man’s) shoulder, steadying both the
man and the pingo with his trunk and fore legs. But the
man of course did not move or stand up with his pingo.
Seeing this, the elephant again raised the cooly and dashed
him against the ground, and then trampled the body to a
very jelly. This done, he took up the pingo and moved
away from the spot; but at the distance of about a fathom
or two, laid it down again, and ripping open one of the
bundles, took out of it all the contents, <i>somans</i>,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> <i>cambāyas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
handkerchiefs, and several pieces of white cambrick cloth,
all which he tore to small pieces, and flung them wildly
here and there. He did the same with all the other pingoes.
When this was over the elephant quietly walked away into
the jungle, trumpeting all the way as far as I could hear.
When danger was past I came out of my concealment, and
returned to the place where we had halted that morning.
Here the rest of my companions joined me soon after.
The next morning we set out again on our journey, our party
being now increased by some seven or eight traders from
Salpity Corle: but this time we did not meet with the
elephant. We found the mangled corpse of our cooly on the
same spot where I had seen it the day before, together with
the torn pieces of my cloths, of which we collected as fast
as we could the few which were serviceable, and all the
brass utensils which were quite uninjured. That elephant
was a noted rogue. He had before this killed many people
on that road, especially those carrying pingoes of coco-nut
oil and ghee. He was afterwards killed by an Englishman.
The incidents I have mentioned above, took place about
twenty years ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>The following also relates to the same locality. It was
narrated to me by an old Moorman of Barberyn, who, during
his earlier years, led the life of a pedlar.</p>

<p>2. “I and another,” said he, “were on our way to Badulla,
one day some twenty-five or thirty years ago. We were
quietly moving along a path which wound round a hill, when
all of a sudden, and without the slightest previous intimation
either by the rustling of leaves or by any other sign, a huge
elephant with short tusks rushed to the path. Where he had
been before I can’t say; I believe he must have been lying in
wait for travellers. In a moment he rushed forward to the
road, trumpeting dreadfully, and seized my companion. I,
who happened to be in the rear, took to flight, pursued by
the elephant, which had already killed my companion by
striking him against the ground. I had not moved more
than seven or eight fathoms, when the elephant seized me,
and threw me up with such force, that I was carried high
into the air towards a <i>Cahata</i> tree, whose branches caught
me and prevented my falling to the ground. By this I
received no other injury than the dislocation of one of my
wrists. I do not know whether the elephant saw me after
he had hurled me away through the air; but certainly he
did not come to the tree to which I was then clinging: even
if he had come, he couldn’t have done me any more harm,
as the branch on which I was was far beyond the reach of
his trunk, and the tree itself too large for him to pull down.
The next thing I saw was the elephant returning to the
corpse of my companion, which he again threw on the
ground, and placing one of his fore-feet on it, he tore it with
his trunk limb after limb; and dabbled in the blood that
flowed from the shapeless mass of flesh which he was still
holding under his foot.”</p>

<p>3. “In 1847 or ’46,” said another informant, “I was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
superintendent of a coco-nut estate belonging to Mr.
Armitage, situated about twelve miles from Negombo. A
rogue elephant did considerable injury to the estate at that
time; and one day, hearing that it was then on the plantation,
a Mr. Lindsay, an Englishman, who was proprietor of the
adjoining property, and myself, accompanied by some seven
or eight people of the neighbouring village, went out, carrying
with us six rifles loaded and primed. We continued to
walk along a path which, near one of its turns, had some
bushes on one side. We had calculated to come up with the
brute where it had been seen half an hour before; but no
sooner had one of our men, who was walking foremost, seen
the animal at the distance of some fifteen or twenty fathoms,
than he exclaimed, ‘There! there!’ and immediately took to
his heels, and we all followed his example. The elephant
did not see us until we had run some fifteen or twenty paces
from the spot where we turned, when he gave us chase,
screaming frightfully as he came on. The Englishman
managed to climb a tree, and the rest of my companions did
the same; as for myself I could not, although I made one or
two superhuman efforts. But there was no time to be lost.
The elephant was running at me with his trunk bent down
in a curve towards the ground. At this critical moment Mr.
Lindsay held out his foot to me, with the help of which and
then of the branches of the tree, which were three or four
feet above my head, I managed to scramble up to a branch.
The elephant came directly to the tree and attempted to
force it down, which he could not. He first coiled his trunk
round the stem, and pulled it with all his might, but with
no effect. He then applied his head to the tree, and pushed
for several minutes, but with no better success. He then
trampled with his feet all the projecting roots, moving, as he
did so, several times round and round the tree. Lastly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
failing in all this, and seeing a pile of timber, which I had
lately cut, at a short distance from us, he removed it all
(thirty-six pieces) one at a time to the root of the tree, and
piled them up in a regular business-like manner; then
placing his hind feet on this pile, he raised the fore part of
his body, and reached out his trunk, but still he could not
touch us, as we were too far above him. The Englishman
then fired, and the ball took effect somewhere on the elephant’s
head, but did not kill him. It made him only the
more furious. The next shot, however, levelled him to the
ground. I afterwards brought the skull of the animal to
Colombo, and it is still to be seen at the house of Mr.
Armitage.”</p>

<p>4. “One night a herd of elephants entered a village in the
Four Corles. After doing considerable injury to plaintain
bushes and young coco-nut trees, they retired, the villagers
being unable to do anything to protect their fruit trees from
destruction. But one elephant was left behind, who continued
to scream the whole night through at the same spot.
It was then discovered that the elephant, on seeing a jak
fruit on a tree somewhat beyond the reach of his trunk,
had raised himself on his hind legs, placing his fore feet
against the stem, in order to lay hold of the fruit, but
unluckily for him there happened to be another tree standing
so close to it that the vacant space between the two stems
was only a few inches. During his attempts to take hold
of the fruit one of his legs happened to get in between the
two trees, where, on account of his weight and his clumsy
attempts to extricate himself, it got so firmly wedged that
he could not remove it. and in this awkward position he
remained for some days, till he died on the spot.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
<small><small>ELEPHANT SHOOTING.</small></small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the shooting of an elephant, whatever endurance
and adroitness the sport may display in other respects,
requires the smallest possible skill as a marksman, the
numbers which are annually slain in this way may be
regarded less as a test of the expertness of the sportsman,
than as evidence of the multitudes of elephants abounding
in those parts of Ceylon to which they resort. One
officer, Major <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>, killed upwards of 1,400; another,
Captain <span class="smcap">Gallwey</span>, has the credit of slaying more than
half that number; Major <span class="smcap">Skinner</span>, the Commissioner of
Roads, almost as many; and less persevering aspirants
follow at humbler distances.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>
<p>But notwithstanding this prodigious destruction, a
reward of a few shillings per head offered by the
Government for taking elephants was claimed for 3,500
destroyed in part of the northern province alone, in
less than three years prior to 1848; and between 1851
and 1856, a similar reward was paid for 2,000 in the
southern province, between Galle and Hambangtotte.</p>

<p>Although there is little opportunity in an elephant
battue for the display of proficiency as a shot there is
one feature in the sport, as conducted in Ceylon, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>contrasts favourably with the slaughterhouse details
chronicled with revolting minuteness in some recent
accounts of elephant shooting in South Africa. The
practice in Ceylon is to aim invariably at the head, and
the sportsman finds his safety to consist in boldly facing
the animal, advancing to within fifteen paces, and lodging
a bullet, either in the temple or in the hollow over the
eye, or in a well-known spot immediately above the
trunk, where the weaker structure of the skull affords
an easy access to the brain.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> The region of the ear is
also a fatal spot, and often resorted to,—the places I have
mentioned in the front of the head being only accessible
when the animal is “charging.” Professor <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>, in
his communication to the Royal Irish Academy on the
Anatomy of the Elephant, has rendered an intelligible
explanation of this in the following passage descriptive
of the cranium:—“It exhibits two remarkable facts:
<i>first</i>, the small space occupied by the brain; and,
<i>secondly</i>, the beautiful and curious structure of the bones
of the head. The two tables of all these bones, except
the occipital, are separated by rows of large cells, some
from four to five inches in length, others only small,
irregular, and honey-comb-like:—these all communicate
with each other, and, through the frontal sinuses, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>the cavity of the nose, and also with the tympanum
or drum of each ear; consequently, as in some birds,
these cells are filled with air, and thus while the skull
attains a great size in order to afford an extensive surface
for the attachment of muscles, and a mechanical support
for the tusks, it is at the same time very light and
buoyant in proportion to its bulk; a property the more
valuable as the animal is fond of water and bathes in
deep rivers.”</p>

<img src="images/i_p080.jpg" width="400" height="475" alt="" />
<div class="caption">SECTION OF ELEPHANT’S HEAD. </div>
</div>

<p>Generally speaking, as regards the elephants of Ceylon,
a single ball, planted in the forehead, ends the existence
of the noble creature instantaneously: and expert sports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>men
have been known to kill right and left, one with
each barrel; but occasionally an elephant will not fall
before several shots have been lodged in his head. But
as regards the African elephant, Sir S. Baker, the explorer
of the Nile, than whom no one has had greater experience
of elephant shooting in both countries, is of opinion
that, owing to a peculiar configuration of the head, it is
next to impossible to kill by a front shot.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>Contrasted with this, one reads with a shudder the
sickening details of the African huntsman approaching
<i>behind</i> the retiring animal, and of the torture inflicted by
the shower of bullets which tear up its flesh and lacerate
its flank and shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>The shooting of elephants in Ceylon has been described
with tiresome iteration in the successive journals
of sporting gentlemen, but one who turns to their pages
for natural traits of the animal and his instincts is disappointed
to find little beyond graphic sketches of the
daring and exploits of his pursuers, most of whom,
having had no further opportunity of observation than
is derived from a casual encounter with the outraged
animal, have apparently tried to exalt their own prowess
by misrepresenting the ordinary character of the elephant,
describing it as “savage, wary, and revengeful.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>These epithets may undoubtedly apply to the outcasts
from the herd, the “rogues” or <i>hora allia</i>, but so small
is the proportion of these that there is not probably more
than one <i>rogue</i> to be found for every five hundred of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>those in herds; and it is a manifest error, arising from
imperfect information, to extend this censure to elephants
generally, or to suppose it to be an animal “thirsting
for blood, lying in wait in the jungle to rush on the
unwary passer-by, and knowing no greater pleasure than
the act of crushing his victim to a shapeless mass beneath
his feet.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> The cruelties practised by hunters have no
doubt taught these sagacious creatures to be cautious
and alert, but their precautions are simply defensive;
and beyond the alarm and apprehension which they
evince on the approach of man, they exhibit no indication
of hostility or thirst for blood.</p>

<p>An ordinary traveller seldom comes upon elephants
unless after sunset or towards daybreak, as they go to or
return from their nightly visits to the tanks: but when
by accident a herd is disturbed by day, they evince, if
unattacked, no disposition to become assailants; and if
the attitude of defence which they instinctively assume
prove sufficient to check the approach of the intruder, no
further demonstration is to be apprehended.</p>

<p>Even the hunters who go in search of them find them
in positions and occupations altogether inconsistent with
the idea of their being savage, wary, or revengeful.
Their demeanour when undisturbed is indicative of
gentleness and timidity, and their actions bespeak lassitude
and indolence, induced not alone by heat, but
probably ascribable in some degree to the fact that the
night has been spent in watchfulness and amusement.
A few are generally browsing listlessly on the trees and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>plants within reach, others fanning themselves with leafy
branches, and a few are asleep; whilst the young run
playfully among the herd, the emblems of innocence, as
the older ones are of peacefulness and gravity.</p>

<p>Almost every elephant may be observed to exhibit
some peculiar action of the limbs when standing at rest;
some move the head monotonously in a circle, or from
right to left; some swing their feet back and forward;
others flap their ears or sway themselves from side to side,
or rise and sink by alternately bending and straightening
the fore knees. As the opportunities of observing this
custom have been almost confined to elephants in captivity,
it has been conjectured to arise from some morbid
habit contracted during the length of a voyage by sea,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
or from an instinctive impulse to substitute an artificial
motion in lieu of their wonted exercise; but this supposition
is erroneous; the propensity being equally displayed
by those at liberty and those in captivity. When
surprised by sportsmen in the depths of the jungle,
individuals of a herd are always to be seen occupied in
swinging their limbs in this manner; and in the corrals
which I have seen, where whole herds have been captured,
the elephants, in the midst of the utmost excitement, and
even after the most vigorous charges, if they halted for
a moment in stupor and exhaustion, manifested their
wonted habit, and swung their limbs or swayed their
bodies to and fro incessantly. So far from its being a
substitute for exercise, those in the Government employment
in Ceylon are observed to practise their acquired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>motion, whatever it may be, with increased vigour when
thoroughly fatigued after excessive work. Even the
favourite practice of fanning themselves with a leafy
branch seems less an enjoyment in itself than a resource
when listless and at rest. The term “fidgetty” seems
to describe appropriately the temperament of the elephant.</p>

<p>They evince the strongest love of retirement and a
corresponding dislike to intrusion. The approach of a
stranger is perceived less by the eye, the quickness of
which is not remarkable (besides which its range is
obscured by the foliage), than by sensitive smell and
singular acuteness of hearing; and the whole herd is
put in instant but noiseless motion towards some deeper
and more secure retreat. The effectual manner in which
an animal of the prodigious size of the elephant can
conceal himself, and the motionless silence which he
preserves, is quite surprising; whilst beaters pass and
repass within a few yards of his hiding place, he will
maintain his ground till the hunter, creeping almost
close to his legs, sees his little eye peering out through
the leaves, when, finding himself discovered, the elephant
breaks away with a crash, levelling the brushwood in his
headlong career.</p>

<p>If surprised in open ground, where stealthy retreat is
impracticable, a herd will hesitate in indecision, and, after
a few meaningless movements, stand huddled together in
a group, whilst one or two, more adventurous than the
rest, advance a few steps to reconnoitre. Elephants are
generally observed to be bolder in open ground than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
cover, but, if bold at all, far more dangerous in cover
than in open ground.</p>

<p>In searching for them, sportsmen often avail themselves
of the expertness of the native trackers; and
notwithstanding the demonstration of Combe that the
brain of the timid Singhalese is deficient in the organ of
destructiveness,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> he shows an instinct for hunting, and
exhibits in the pursuit of the elephant a courage and
adroitness far surpassing in interest the mere handling of
the rifle, which is the principal share of the proceeding
that falls to his European companions.</p>

<p>The beater on these occasions has the double task of
finding the game and carrying the guns; and, in an
animated communication to me, an experienced sportsman
describes “this light and active creature, with his
long glossy hair hanging down his shoulders, every
muscle quivering with excitement; and his countenance
lighting up with intense animation, leaping from rock to
rock, as nimble as a chamois, tracking the gigantic game
like a blood-hound, falling behind as he comes up with
it, and as the elephants, baffled and irritated, make the
first stand, passing one rifle into your eager hand and
holding the other ready whilst right and left each barrel
performs its mission, and if fortune does not flag, and
the second gun is as successful as the first, three or four
huge carcases are piled one on another within a space
equal to the area of a dining room.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>It is curious that in these encounters the herd never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>rush forward in a body, as buffaloes or bisons do, but
only one elephant at a time moves in advance of the
rest to confront, or, as it is called, to “charge,” the
assailants. I have heard of but one instance in which
<i>two</i> so advanced as champions of their companions.
Sometimes, indeed, the whole herd will follow a leader,
and manœuvre in his rear like a body of cavalry; but
so large a party are necessarily liable to panic; and, one
of them having turned in alarm, the entire body retreat
with terrified precipitation.</p>

<p>As regards boldness and courage, a strange variety of
temperament is observable amongst elephants, but it may
be affirmed that they are much more generally timid
than courageous. One herd may be as difficult to approach
as deer, gliding away through the jungle so gently
and quickly that scarcely a trace marks their passage;
another, in apparent stupor, will huddle themselves
together like swine, and allow their assailant to come
within a few yards before they break away in terror; and
a third will await his approach without motion, and then
advance with fury to the “charge.”</p>

<p>In individuals the same differences are discernible;
one flies on the first appearance of danger, whilst
another, alone and unsupported, will face a whole host
of enemies. When wounded and infuriated with pain,
many of them become literally savage;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> but, so unaccustomed
are they to act as assailants, and so awkward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>and inexpert in using their strength, that they rarely or
ever succeed in killing a pursuer who falls into their
power. Although the pressure of a foot, a blow with
the trunk, or a thrust with the tusk, could scarcely fail to
prove fatal, three-fourths of those so overtaken have
escaped without serious injury. So great is this chance
of impunity, that the sportsman prefers to approach
within about fifteen paces of the advancing elephant, a
space which gives time for a second fire should the firsts
shot prove ineffectual, and should both fail there is still
opportunity for flight.</p>

<p>Amongst full-grown timber, a skilful runner can escape
from an elephant by “dodging” round the trees, but in
cleared land, and low brushwood, the difficulty is much
increased, as the small growth of underwood which
obstructs the movements of man presents no obstacle to
those of an elephant. On the other hand, on level and
open ground the chances are rather in favour of the elephant,
as his pace in full flight exceeds that of man,
although as a general rule, it is unequal to that of a
horse, as has been sometimes asserted.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>The incessant slaughter of elephants by sportsmen in
Ceylon, appears to be merely in subordination to the influence
of the organ of destructiveness, since the carcase
is never applied to any useful purpose, but left to decompose
and to defile the air of the forest. The flesh is
occasionally tasted as a matter of curiosity: as a steak
it is coarse and tough; but the tongue is as delicate as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>that of an ox; and the foot is said to make palatable
soup. The Caffres attached to the pioneer corps in the
Kandyan province are in the habit of securing the heart
of any elephant shot in their vicinity, and say it is their
custom to eat it in Africa. The hide it has been found
impracticable to tan in Ceylon, or to convert to any
useful purpose, but the bones of those shot have of late
years been collected and used for manuring coffee estates.
The hair of the tail, which is extremely strong and horny,
is mounted by the native goldsmith, and made into
bracelets; and the teeth are sawn by the Moormen at
Galle (as they used to be by the Romans during a
scarcity of ivory) into plates, out of which they fashion
numerous articles of ornament, knife-handles, card racks,
and “presse-papiers.”</p>

<h4>NOTE.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> extraordinary recoveries from desperate wounds, I
venture to record here an instance which occurred in Ceylon
to a gentleman while engaged in the chase of elephants, and
which, I apprehend, has few parallels in pathological experience.
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Gerard Fretz</span>, of the Ceylon Rifle
Regiment, whilst firing at an elephant in the vicinity of Fort
MacDonald, in Ouvah, was wounded in the face by the
bursting of his fowling-piece, on the 22nd January, 1828. He
was then about thirty-two years of age. On raising him, it
was found that part of the breech of the gun and about two
inches of the barrel had been driven through the frontal sinus
at the junction of the nose and forehead. It had sunk almost
perpendicularly till the iron plate called “the tail-pin,” by
which the barrel is made fast to the stock by a screw, had
descended through the palate, carrying with it the screw, one
extremity of which had forced itself into the right nostril,
where it was discernible externally, whilst the headed end
lay in contact with his tongue. To extract the jagged mass
of iron thus sunk in the ethmoidal and sphenoidal cells was
found hopelessly impracticable; but strange to tell, after the
inflammation subsided, Mr. <span class="smcap">Fretz</span> recovered rapidly; his
general health was unimpaired, and he returned to his regiment
with this singular appendage firmly embedded behind
the bones of his face. He took his turn of duty as usual,
attained the command of his company, participated in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
enjoyments of the mess-room, and died <i>eight years afterwards</i>,
on the 1st of April, 1836, not from any consequences of this
fearful wound, but from fever and inflammation brought on
by other causes.</p>

<p>So little was he apparently inconvenienced by the presence
of the strange body in his palate that he was accustomed with
his finger partially to undo the screw, which but for its
extreme length he might altogether have withdrawn. To
enable this to be done, and possibly to assist by this means
the extraction of the breech itself through the original orifice
(which never entirely closed), an attempt was made in 1835
to take off a portion of the screw with a file; but, after having
cut it three parts through the operation was interrupted,
chiefly owing to the carelessness and indifference of Capt.
<span class="smcap">Fretz</span>, whose death occurred before the attempt could be
resumed. The piece of iron, on being removed after his
decease, was found to measure 2-3/4 inches in length, and
weighed two scruples more than two ounces and three
quarters. A cast of the breech and screw now forms
No. 2790 amongst the deposits in the Medical Museum of
Chatham.</p></blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />

<small><small>AN ELEPHANT CORRAL.</small></small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> long as the elephants of Ceylon were merely required
in small numbers for the pageantry of the native princes,
or the sacred processions of the Buddhist temples,
their capture was effected either by the instrumentality of
female decoys, or by the artifices and agility of the
individuals and castes who devoted themselves to their
pursuit and training. But after the arrival of the European
conquerors of the island, and when it had become
expedient to take advantage of the strength and intelligence
of these creatures in clearing forests and constructing
roads and other works, establishments were organised
on a great scale by the Portuguese and Dutch,
and the supply of elephants kept up by periodical battues
conducted at the cost of the Government, on a plan
similar to that adopted on the continent of India, when
herds varying in number from twenty to one hundred
and upwards are driven into concealed enclosures and
secured.</p>

<p>In both these processes, success is entirely dependent
on the skill with which the captors turn to advantage the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
panic and inexperience of the wild elephant, since all
attempts would be futile to subdue or confine by ordinary
force an animal of such strength and sagacity.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knox</span> describes with circumstantiality the mode
adopted, two centuries ago, by the servants of the King
of Kandy to catch elephants for the royal stud. He
says, “After discovering the retreat of such as have
tusks, unto these they drive some <i>she elephants</i>, which
they bring with them for the purpose, which, when once
the males have got a sight of, they will never leave, but
follow them wheresoever they go; and the females are so
used to it that they will do whatsoever, either by word
or a beck, their keepers bid them. And so they delude
them along through towns and countries, and through the
streets of the city, even to the very gates of the king’s
palace, where sometimes they seize upon them by snares,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>and sometimes by driving them into a kind of pound,
they catch them.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>In Nepaul and Burmah, and throughout the Chin-Indian
Peninsula, when in pursuit of single elephants,
either <i>rogues</i> detached from the herd, or individuals
who have been marked for the beauty of their ivory,
the natives avail themselves of the aid of females in
order to effect their approaches and secure an opportunity
of casting a noose over the foot of the destined
captive. All accounts concur in expressing high admiration
of their courage and address; but from what has
fallen under my own observation, added to the descriptions
I have heard from other eye-witnesses, I am inclined
to believe that in such exploits the Moormen of Ceylon
evince a daring and adroitness, surpassing all others.</p>

<p>These professional elephant catchers, or, as they are
called, Panickeas, inhabit the Moorish villages in the
north and north-east of the island, and from time immemorial
have been engaged in taking elephants, which
are afterwards trained by Arabs, chiefly for the use of
the rajahs and native princes in the south of India,
whose vakeels are periodically despatched to make purchases
in Ceylon.</p>

<p>The ability evinced by these men in tracing elephants
through the woods has almost the certainty of instinct;
and hence their services are eagerly sought by the European
sportsmen who go down into their country in search
of game. So keen is their glance, that like hounds
running “breast high” they will follow the course of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>elephant, almost at the top of their speed, over glades
covered with stunted grass, where the eye of a stranger
would fail to discover a trace of its passage, and on
through forests strewn with dry leaves, where it seems
impossible to perceive a footstep. Here they are guided
by a bent or broken twig, or by a leaf dropped from the
animal’s mouth, on which the pressure of a tooth may be
detected. If at fault, they fetch a circuit like a setter,
till lighting on some fresh marks, they go a-head again
with renewed vigour. So delicate is the sense of smell
in the elephant, and so indispensable is it to go against
the wind in approaching him, that on those occasions
when the wind is so still that its direction cannot be
otherwise discerned, the Panickeas will suspend the film
of a gossamer to determine it and shape their course
accordingly.</p>

<p>They are enabled by the inspection of the footmarks,
when impressed in soft clay, to describe the size as well
as the number of a herd before it is seen; the height of
an elephant at the shoulder being as nearly as possible
twice the circumference of his fore foot.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>On overtaking the game their courage is as conspicuous
as their sagacity. If they have confidence in the sportsman
for whom they are finding, they will advance to the
very heel of the elephant, slap him on the quarter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>convert his timidity into anger, till he turns upon his tormentor
and exposes his front to receive the bullet which
awaits him.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>So fearless and confident are they, that two men, without
aid or attendants, will boldly attempt to capture the
largest-sized elephant. Their only weapon is a flexible
rope made of deer’s or buffalo’s hide, with which it is
their object to secure one of the hind legs. This they
effect either by following in its footsteps when in motion
or by stealing close up to it when at rest, and availing
themselves of its well known propensity at such moments
to swing the feet backwards and forwards, they contrive
to slip a noose over the hind leg.</p>

<p>At other times this is achieved by spreading the noose
on the ground partially concealed by roots and leaves
beneath a tree on which one of the party is stationed,
whose business it is to lift it suddenly by means of a cord,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>raising it on the elephant’s leg at the moment when his
companion has succeeded in provoking him to place his
foot within the circle, the other end having been previously
made fast to the stem of the tree. Should the
noosing be effected in open ground, and no tree of sufficient
strength be at hand round which to wind the rope,
one of the Moors, allowing himself to be pursued by the
enraged elephant, entices him towards the nearest grove;
where his companion, dexterously laying hold of the rope
as it trails along the ground, suddenly coils it round a
suitable stem, and brings the fugitive to a stand-still.
On finding himself thus arrested, the natural impulse of
the captive is to turn on the man who is engaged in
making fast the rope, a movement which it is the duty
of his colleague to prevent by running up close to the
elephant’s head and provoking the animal to confront
him by irritating gesticulations and taunting shouts of
<i>dah! dah!</i> a monosyllable, the sound of which the elephant
peculiarly dislikes. Meanwhile the first assailant,
having secured one noose, comes up from behind with
another, with which, amidst the vain rage and struggles
of the victim, he entraps a fore leg, the rope being, as
before, secured to another tree in front, and the whole
four feet having been thus entangled, the capture is
completed.</p>

<p>A shelter is then run up with branches, to protect the
captive from the sun, and the hunters proceed to build a
wigwam for themselves in front of him, kindling their
fires for cooking, and making all the necessary arrangements
for remaining day and night on the spot to await
the process of subduing and taming his rage. In my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
journeys through the forest I have come unexpectedly on
the halting place of adventurous hunters when thus engaged;
and on one occasion, about sunrise, in ascending
the steep ridge from the bed of the Malwatte river, the
foremost rider of our party was suddenly driven back by
the trumpeting of a furious elephant, which we found
picketed by two Panickeas on the crest of the bank. In
such restraint, the elephant soon ceases to struggle; and
what with the exhaustion of rage and resistance, the
terror of fire which he dreads, and the constant annoyance
of smoke which he detests, in a very short time, a
few weeks at the most, his spirit becomes subdued; then
being plentifully supplied with plantains and fresh food,
and indulged with water, in which he luxuriates, he grows
so far reconciled to his keepers that they at length venture
to remove him to their own village, and eventually
to the sea-side for shipment to India.</p>

<p>No part of the hunter’s performances exhibits greater
skill and audacity than this first forced march of the
recently captured elephant through the great central
forests to the sea-coast. As he is still too morose to
submit to be ridden, and it would be equally impossible
to lead or to drive him by force, the ingenuity of the
captors is displayed in alternately irritating and eluding
him, but always so attracting his attention as to allure
him along in the direction in which they want him to go.
Some assistance is derived from the rope by which the
original capture was effected, and which, as it serves to
make him safe at night, is never removed from the leg
till his taming is sufficiently advanced to permit of his
being entrusted with partial liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>In Ceylon the principal place for exporting these animals
to India is Manaar, on the western coast, to which
the Arabs from the continent resort, bringing with them
horses to be bartered for elephants. In order to reach
the sea, open plains must be traversed, across which it
requires the utmost courage, agility, and patience of the
Moors to coax their reluctant charge. At Manaar the
elephants are usually detained till any wound on the leg
caused by the rope has been healed, when the shipment
is effected in the most primitive manner. It being next
to impossible to induce the still untamed creature to walk
on board, and no mechanical contrivances being provided
to ship him, a dhoney, or native boat, of about forty
tons’ burthen, and about three parts filled with the strong
ribbed leaves of the Palmyra palm, is brought alongside
the quay in front of the Old Dutch Fort, and lashed so
that the gunwale may be as nearly as possible on a line
with the level of the wharf. The elephant being placed
with his back to the water is forced by goads to retreat
till his hind legs go over the side of the quay, but the
main contest commences when it is attempted to disengage
his fore feet from the shore, and force him to entrust
himself on board. The scene becomes exciting
from the screams and trumpeting of the elephants, the
shouts of the Arabs, the calls of the Moors, and the
rushing of the crowd. Meanwhile the huge creature
strains every nerve to regain the land; and the day is
often consumed before his efforts are overcome, and he
finds himself fairly afloat. The same dhoney will take
from four to five elephants, who place themselves athwart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
it, and exhibit amusing adroitness in accommodating
their movements to the rolling of the little vessel; and in
this way they are ferried across the narrow strait which
separates Ceylon from the continent of India.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>But the feat of ensnaring and subduing a single elephant,
courageous as it is, and demonstrative of the
supremacy with which man wields his “dominion over
every beast of the earth,” falls far short of the daring
exploit of capturing a whole herd: when from thirty to
one hundred wild elephants are entrapped in one vast
decoy. The mode of effecting this, as it is practised in
Ceylon, is no doubt imitated, but with considerable
modification, from the methods prevalent in various
parts of India. It was introduced by the Portuguese,
and continued by the Dutch, the latter of whom had
two elephant hunts in each year, and conducted their
operations on so large a scale, that the annual export,
after supplying the Government establishments, was from
one hundred to one hundred and fifty elephants, taken
principally in the vicinity of Matura, in the southern province,
and marched for shipment to Manaar.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>The custom in Bengal is to construct a strong enclosure
(called a <i>keddah</i>), in the heart of the forest, formed
of the trunks of trees firmly secured by transverse beams
and buttresses, and leaving a gate for the entrance of
the elephants. A second enclosure, opening from the
first, contains water (if possible a rivulet); this, again,
communicates with a third, which terminates in a funnel-shaped
passage, too narrow to admit of an elephant turning,
and within this the captives being driven in line, are
secured with ropes introduced from the outside, and led
away in custody of tamed ones trained for the purpose.</p>

<p>The <i>keddah</i> being prepared, the first operation is to
drive the elephants towards it, for which purpose vast
bodies of men fetch a compass in the forest around the
haunts of the herds, contracting it by degrees till they
complete the enclosure of a certain area, round which
they kindle fires, and cut footpaths through the jungle, to
enable the watchers to communicate and combine. All
this is performed in cautious silence and by slow approaches,
to avoid alarming the herd. A fresh circle
nearer to the <i>keddah</i> is then formed in the same way, and
into this the elephants are admitted from the first one,
the hunters following from behind, and lighting new fires
around the newly inclosed space. Day after day the process
is repeated; till the drove having been brought sufficiently
close to make the final rush, the whole party
close in from all sides, and with drums, guns, shouts, and
flambeaux, force the terrified animals to enter the fatal
enclosure, when the passage is barred behind them, and
retreat rendered impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>Their efforts to escape are repressed by the crowd,
who drive them back from the stockade with spears
and flaming torches; and at last compel them to pass
on into the second inclosure. Here they are detained
for a short time, and their feverish exhaustion relieved
by free access to water;—until at last, being tempted
by food, or otherwise induced to trust themselves in the
narrow outlet, they are one after another made fast by
ropes, passed in through the palisade; and picketed in
the adjoining woods to enter on their course of systematic
training.</p>

<p>These arrangements vary in different districts of
Bengal; and the method adopted in Ceylon differs in
many essential particulars from them all; the keddah,
or, as it is here called, the corral or <i>korahl</i><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> (from the
Portuguese <i>curral</i>, a “cattle-pen”), consists of but one
enclosure instead of three. A stream or watering-place
is not uniformly enclosed within it, because, although
water is indispensable after the long thirst and exhaustion
of the captives, it has been found that a pond
or rivulet within the corral itself adds to the difficulty
of leading them out, and increases their reluctance to
leave it; besides which, the smaller ones are often
smothered by the others in their eagerness to crowd into
the water. The funnel-shaped outlet is also dispensed
with, as the animals are liable to bruise and injure themselves
within the narrow stockade; and should one of
them die in it, as is too often the case in the midst of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>the struggle, the difficulty of removing so great a carcase
is extreme. The noosing and securing them, therefore,
takes place in Ceylon within the area of the first enclosure
into which they enter, and the dexterity and
daring displayed in this portion of the work far surpasses
that of merely attaching the rope through the openings
of the paling, as in an Indian keddah.</p>

<p>One result of this change in the system is manifested
in the increased proportion of healthy elephants eventually
secured and trained out of the number originally
enclosed. The reason of this is obvious: under the old
arrangements, months were consumed in the preparatory
steps of surrounding and driving in the herds, which at
last arrived so wasted by excitement and exhausted by
privation that numbers died within the corral itself, and
still more under the process of training. But in later
years the labour of months has been reduced to weeks,
and the elephants are driven in fresh and full of vigour,
so that comparatively few are lost either in the enclosure
or the stables. A conception of the whole operation
from commencement to end will be best conveyed by
describing the progress of an elephant corral as I witnessed
it in 1847 in the great forest on the banks of the
Alligator River, the Kimbul-oya, in the district of Kornegalle,
about thirty miles north-west of Kandy.</p>

<p>Kornegalle, or Kurunai-galle, was one of the ancient
capitals of the island, and the residence of its kings
from <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1319 to 1347.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> The dwelling-house of the
principal civil officer in charge of the district now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>occupies the site of the former palace, and the ground
is strewn with fragments of columns and carved stones,
the remnants of the royal buildings. The modern town
consists of the bungalows of the European officials, each
surrounded with its own garden; two or three streets
inhabited by Dutch descendants and by Moors; and a
native bazaar, with the ordinary array of rice and curry
stuffs and cooking chattees of brass or burnt clay.</p>

<p>The charm of the village is the unusual beauty of its
position. It rests within the shade of an enormous rock
of gneiss upwards of 600 feet in height, nearly denuded
of verdure, and so rounded and worn by time that it has
acquired the form of a couchant elephant, from which it
derives its name of Aetagalla, the Rock of the Tusker.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
But Aetagalla is only the last eminence in a range of
similarly-formed rocky mountains, which here terminate
abruptly; and which, from the fantastic shapes into
which their gigantic outlines have been wrought by the
action of the atmosphere, are called by the names of the
Tortoise Rock, the Eel Rock, and the Rock of the
Tusked Elephant. So impressed are the Singhalese by
the aspect of these stupendous masses that in ancient
grants lands are conveyed in perpetuity, or “so long as
the sun and the moon, so long as Aetagalla and Andagalla
shall endure.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Kornegalle is the resort of Buddhists from the remotest
parts of the island, who come to visit an ancient
temple on the summit of the great rock, to which access
is had from the valley below by means of steep paths
and steps hewn out of the solid stone. Here the chief
object of veneration is a copy of the sacred footstep
hollowed in the granite, similar to that which confers
sanctity on Adam’s Peak, the towering apex of which,
about forty miles distant, the pilgrims can discern from
Aetagalla.</p>

<p>At times the heat at Kornegalle is intense, in consequence
of the perpetual glow diffused from these granite
cliffs. The warmth they acquire during the blaze of
noon becomes almost intolerable towards evening, and
the sultry night is too short to permit the rocks to cool
between the setting and the rising of the sun. The
district is also liable to occasional droughts when the
watercourses fail, and the tanks become dry. One of
these calamities occurred about the period of my visit,
and such was the suffering of the wild animals that
numbers of crocodiles and bears made their way into the
town to drink at the wells. The soil is prolific in the
extreme; rice, cotton, and dry grain are cultivated
largely in the valley. Every cottage is surrounded by
gardens of cocoa-nuts, arecas, jak-fruit and coffee; the
slopes, under tillage, are covered with luxuriant vegetation,
and, as far as the eye can reach on every side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>there are dense forests intersected by streams, in the
shade of which the deer and the elephant abound.</p>

<p>In 1847 arrangements were made for one of the great
elephant hunts for the supply of the Civil Engineer’s
Department, and the spot fixed on by Mr. Morris, the
Government officer who conducted the corral, was on
the banks of the Kimbul river, about fifteen miles from
Kornegalle. The country over which we rode to the
scene of the approaching capture showed traces of the
recent drought, the fields lay to a great extent untilled,
owing to the want of water, and the tanks, almost reduced
to dryness, were covered with the leaves of the
rose-coloured lotus.</p>

<p>Our cavalcade was as oriental as the scenery through
which it moved; the Governor and the officers of his
staff and household formed a long cortége, escorted by
the native attendants, horse-keepers, and foot-runners.
The ladies were borne in palankins, and the younger
individuals of the party carried in chairs raised on poles,
and covered with cool green awnings made of the fresh
leaves of the talipat palm.</p>

<p>After traversing the cultivated lands, the path led
across open glades of park-like verdure and beauty, and
at last entered the great forest under the shade of ancient
trees wreathed to their crowns with climbing plants and
festooned by natural garlands of convolvulus and orchids.
Here silence reigned, disturbed only by the murmuring
hum of glittering insects, or the shrill clamour of the
plum-headed parroquet and the flute-like calls of the
golden oriole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>We crossed the broad sandy beds of two rivers overarched
by tall trees, the most conspicuous of which is
the kombook,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> from the calcined bark of which the
natives extract a species of lime to be used with their
betel. And from the branches hung suspended over the
water the gigantic pods of the huge puswael bean,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> the
sheath of which measures six feet long by five or six
inches broad.</p>

<p>On ascending the steep bank of the second stream,
we found ourselves in front of the residences which had
been extemporised for our party in the immediate
vicinity of the corral. These cool and enjoyable structures
were formed of branches and thatched with palm
leaves and fragrant lemon grass; and in addition to a
dining-room and suites of bedrooms fitted with tent
furniture, they included kitchens, stables, and storerooms,
all run up by the natives in the course of a few
days.</p>

<p>In former times, the work connected with these elephant
hunts was performed by the “forced labour” of
the natives, as part of that feudal service which under
the name of “raja-kariya” was extorted from the Singhalese
during the rule of their native sovereigns. This
system was continued by the Portuguese and Dutch, and
prevailed under the British Government till its abolition
by the Earl of Ripon in 1832. Under it from fifteen
hundred to two thousand men under the orders of their
headmen, used to be occupied, in constructing the corral,
driving in the elephants, maintaining the cordon of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>watch-fires and watchers, and conducting all the laborious
operations of the capture. Since the abolition of
raja-kariya, however, no difficulty has been found in
obtaining the voluntary co-operation of the natives on
these exciting occasions. The Government defrays the
expense of that portion of the preparations which involves
actual cost, such as the skilled labour expended
in the erection of the corral and its appurtenances,
and the providing of spears, ropes, arms, flutes, drums,
gunpowder, and other necessaries for the occasion.</p>

<p>The period of the year selected is that which least
interferes with the cultivation of the rice-lands (in the
interval between seed time and harvest), and the people
themselves, in addition to the enjoyment of the sport,
have a personal interest in reducing the number of elephants,
which inflict serious injury on their gardens and
growing crops. For a similar reason the priests encourage
the practice, because the elephants destroy
their sacred Bo-trees, of the leaves of which they are
passionately fond; besides which it promotes the facility
for obtaining elephants for the processions of the
temples: and the Raté-mahat-meyas and headmen have
a pride in exhibiting the number of retainers who
follow them to the field, and the performances of their
tame elephants which they lend for the business of
the corral. Thus vast numbers of the peasantry are
voluntarily occupied for many weeks in putting up
the stockades, cutting paths through the jungle, and
relieving the beaters engaged in surrounding and driving
in the elephants.</p>

<div class="caption">METHOD OF FENCING A CORRAL.</div>
</div>

<p>In selecting the scene for an elephant hunt a position is
chosen which lies on some old and frequented route of
the animals, in their periodical migrations in search of
forage and water; and the vicinity of a stream is indispensable,
not only for the supply of the elephants during
the time spent in inducing them to approach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
enclosure, but to enable them to bathe and cool themselves
throughout the process of training after capture.</p>

<p>In constructing the corral itself, care is taken to avoid
disturbing the trees or the brushwood within the included
space, and especially on the side by which the elephants
are to approach, where it is essential to conceal the
stockade as much as possible by the density of the
foliage. The trees used in the structure are from ten to
twelve inches in diameter; and are sunk about three feet
in the earth, so as to leave a length of from twelve to
fifteen feet above ground; with spaces between each
stanchion sufficiently wide to permit a man to glide
through. The uprights are made fast by transverse
beams, to which they are lashed securely by ratans and
flexible climbing plants, or as they are called “jungle
ropes,” and the whole is steadied by means of forked
supports, which grasp the tie beams, and prevent the
work from being driven outward by the rush of the wild
elephants.</p>

<p>On the occasion I am now attempting to describe, the
space thus enclosed was about 500 feet in length by 250
wide. At one end an entrance was left open, fitted with
sliding bars, so prepared as to be capable of being instantly
shut; and from each angle of the end by which
the elephants were to approach, two lines of the same
strong fencing were continued, and cautiously concealed
by the trees; so that if, instead of entering by the open
passage, the herd should swerve to right or left, they
would find themselves suddenly stopped and forced to
retrace their course to the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>The preparations were completed by placing a stage
for the Governor’s party on a group of the nearest trees
looking down into the enclosure, so that a view could be
had of the entire proceeding, from the entrance of the
herd, to the leading out of the captive elephants.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to observe that the structure here
described, massive as it is, would be entirely ineffectual
to resist the shock, if assaulted by the full force of an
enraged elephant; and accidents have sometimes happened
by the breaking through of the herd; but reliance
is placed not so much on the resistance of the stockade
as on the timidity of the captives and their unconsciousness
of their own strength, coupled with the daring of
their captors and their devices for ensuring submission.</p>

<p>The corral being prepared, the beaters address themselves
to drive in the elephants. For this purpose it is
often necessary to fetch a circuit of many miles in order
to surround a sufficient number, and the caution to be
observed involves patience and delay; as it is essential
to avoid alarming the animals, which might otherwise
escape. Their disposition being essentially peaceful, and
their only impulse to browse in solitude and security,
they withdraw instinctively before the slightest intrusion,
and advantage is taken of this timidity and love of seclusion
to cause only just such an amount of disturbance
as will induce them to retire slowly in the direction which
it is desired they should take. Several herds are by this
means concentrated within such an area as will admit of
their being completely surrounded by the watchers; and
day after day, by slow degrees, they are moved gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
onwards towards the immediate confines of the corral.
When their suspicions become awakened and they exhibit
restlessness and alarm, bolder measures are adopted for
preventing their escape. Fires are kept burning at ten
paces apart, night and day, along the circumference of
the area within which they are detained; a corps of from
two to three thousand beaters is completed, and pathways
are carefully cleared through the jungle so as to keep
open a communication along the entire circuit. The
headmen keep up a constant patrol, to see that their
followers are alert at their posts, since neglect at any one
spot might permit the escape of the herd, and undo in a
moment the vigilance of weeks. By this means any attempt
of the elephants to break away is generally checked,
and on any point threatened a sufficient force can be
promptly assembled to drive them back. At last the
elephants are forced onwards so close to the enclosure,
that the investing cordon is united at either end with the
wings of the corral, the whole forming a circuit of about
two miles, within which the herd is detained to await the
signal for the final drive.</p>

<p>Two months had been spent in these preliminaries, and
the preparations had been thus far completed, on the day
when we arrived and took our places on the covered
stand erected for us, overlooking the entrance to the
corral. Close beneath us a group of tame elephants
sent by the temples and the chiefs to assist in securing
the wild ones, were picketed in the shade, and lazily
fanning themselves with leaves. Three distinct herds,
whose united numbers were variously represented at from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
forty to fifty elephants, were enclosed, and were at that
moment concealed in the jungle within a short distance
of the stockade. Not a sound was permitted to be made,
each person spoke to his neighbour in whispers, and such
was the silence observed by the multitude of the watchers
at their posts, that occasionally we could hear the rustling
of the branches as some of the elephants stripped
off a leaf.</p>

<p>Suddenly the signal was made, and the stillness of the
forest was broken by the shouts of the guard, the rolling
of the drums and tom-toms, and the discharge of muskets;
and beginning at the most distant side of the area, the
elephants were hurried forward at a rapid pace towards
the entrance into the corral.</p>

<p>The watchers along the line kept silence only till the
herd had passed them, and then joining the riot in their
rear they drove them onward with redoubled shouts and
deafening noises. The tumult increased as the terrified
rout drew near, swelling now on one side now on the
other, as the herd in their panic dashed from point to
point in their endeavours to force the line, and the crowd
of watchers drove them back with screams, discharges of
muskets, and the discordant roar of drums.</p>

<p>At length the breaking of the branches and the crackling
of the brushwood announced their close approach,
and the leader bursting from the jungle rushed wildly
forward to within twenty yards of the entrance, followed
by the rest of the herd. Another moment and they
would have plunged into the open gate, when suddenly
they wheeled round, re-entered the forest, and in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the hunters resumed their original position. The chief
headman came forward and accounted for the freak by
saying that a wild pig,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> an animal which the elephants are
said to dislike, had started out of the cover and run
across the leader, who would otherwise have held on
direct for the corral; and intimated that as the herd was
now in the highest pitch of excitement; and it was at all
times much more difficult to effect a successful capture by
daylight than by night, when the fires and flambeaux act
with double effect, it was the wish of the hunters to defer
their final effort till the evening, when the darkness would
greatly aid their exertions.</p>

<p>After sunset the scene exhibited was of extraordinary
interest; the low fires, which had apparently only smouldered
in the sunlight, assumed their ruddy glow amidst
the darkness, and threw their tinge over the groups collected
round them; while the smoke rose in eddies
through the rich foliage of the trees. The crowds of
spectators maintained a profound silence, and not a sound
was perceptible louder than the hum of an insect. On
a sudden the stillness was broken by the distant roll of a
drum, followed by a discharge of musketry. This was
the signal for the renewal of the assault, and the hunters
entered the circle with yells and clamour; dry leaves and
sticks were flung upon the watch-fires till they blazed
aloft, and formed a line of flame on every side, except in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>the direction of the corral, which was studiously kept
dark; and thither the terrified elephants betook themselves,
followed by the shouts and racket of their pursuers.</p>

<p>The elephants came on at a rapid pace, trampling
down the brushwood and crushing the dry branches; the
leader emerged in front of the corral, paused for an
instant, stared wildly round, and then rushed madly
through the open gate, followed by the rest of the herd.
Instantly, as if by magic, the entire circuit of the corral,
which up to this moment had been kept in profound
darkness, blazed with thousands of lights, every hunter,
on the instant that the elephants entered, rushing forward
to the stockade with a torch kindled at the nearest
watch-fire.</p>

<p>The elephants first dashed to the very extremity of the
enclosure, and being brought up by the fence, retreated
to regain the gate, but found it closed. Their terror was
sublime: they hurried round the corral at a rapid pace,
but saw it now girt by fire on every side; they attempted
to force the stockade, but were driven back by the guards
with spears and flambeaux; and on whichever side they
approached they were repulsed with shouts and volleys of
musketry. Collecting into one group, they would pause
for a moment in apparent bewilderment, then burst off in
another direction, as if it had suddenly occurred to them
to try some point which they had before overlooked; but,
again baffled, they slowly returned to their forlorn resting-place
in the centre of the corral.</p>

<p>The attraction of this strange scene was not confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
to the spectators; it extended to the tame elephants
which were stationed outside. At the first approach of
the flying herd they evinced the utmost interest. Two in
particular which were picketed near the front were intensely
excited, and continued tossing their heads, pawing
the ground, and starting as the noise drew near. At
length, when the grand rush into the corral took place,
one of them fairly burst from her fastenings and rushed
towards the herd, levelling a tree of considerable size
which obstructed her passage.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>For upwards of an hour the elephants continued to
traverse the corral and assail the palisade with unabated
energy, trumpeting and screaming with rage after each
disappointment. Again and again they attempted to
force the gate, as if aware, by experience, that it ought
to afford an exit as it had already served as an entrance,
but they shrank back stunned and bewildered. By degrees
their efforts became less and less frequent. Single
ones rushed excitedly here and there, returning sullenly
to their companions after each effort; and at last the
whole herd, stupefied and exhausted, formed themselves
into a single group, drawn up in a circle with the young
in the centre, and stood motionless under the dark shade
of the trees in the middle of the corral.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>
<p>Preparations were now made to keep watch during the
night, the guard was reinforced around the enclosure, and
wood heaped on the fires to keep up a high flame till
sunrise.</p>

<p>Three herds had been originally entrapped by the
beaters outside; but with characteristic instinct they had
each kept clear of the other, taking up different stations
in the space invested by the watchers. When the final
drive took place one herd only had entered the enclosure,
the other two keeping behind; and as the gate had to be
instantly shut on the first division, the last were unavoidably
excluded and remained concealed in the jungle.
To prevent their escape, the watchers were ordered to
their former stations, the fires were replenished; and all
precautions having been taken, we returned to pass the
night in our bungalows by the river.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<small><small>THE CAPTIVES.</small></small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> our sleeping-place was not above two hundred yards
from the corral, we were awakened frequently during the
night by the din of the multitude who were bivouacking
in the forest, by the merriment round the watch-fires, and
now and then by the shouts with which the guards repulsed
some sudden charge of the elephants in attempts
to force the stockade. But at daybreak, on going down
to the corral, we found all still and vigilant. The fires
were allowed to die out as the sun rose, and the watchers
who had been relieved were sleeping near the great fence,
the enclosure on all sides being surrounded by crowds of
men and boys with spears or white peeled wands about
ten feet long, whilst the elephants within were huddled
together in a compact group, no longer turbulent and
restless, but exhausted and calm, and utterly subdued by
apprehension and amazement at all that had been passing
around them.</p>

<p>Nine only had been as yet entrapped,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> of which three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>were very large, and two were little creatures but a few
months old. One of the large ones was a “rogue,” and
being unacknowledged by the rest of the herd, he was
not admitted to their circle, although permitted to stand
near them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, preparations were making outside to conduct
the tame elephants into the corral, in order to
secure the captives. Noosed ropes were in readiness;
and far apart from all stood a party of the out-caste
Rodiyas, the only tribe who will touch a dead carcass,
to whom, therefore, the duty is assigned of preparing
the fine flexible rope for noosing, which is made from
the fresh hides of the deer and the buffalo.</p>

<p>At length, the bars which secured the entrance to
the corral were cautiously withdrawn, and two trained
elephants passed stealthily in, each ridden by its mahout
(or <i>ponnekella</i>, as the keeper is termed in Ceylon), and
one attendant; and carrying a strong collar, formed
by coils of rope made from coco-nut fibre, from which
hung on either side cords of elk’s hide, prepared with
a ready noose. Along with these, and concealed behind
them, the headmen of the “<i>cooroowe</i>” or noosers,
crept in, eager to secure the honour of taking the first
elephant, a distinction which this class jealously contests
with the mahouts of the chiefs and temples. He was a
wiry little man, nearly seventy years old, who had served
in the same capacity under the last Kandyan king, and
he wore two silver bangles, which had been conferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>on him in testimony of his prowess. He was accompanied
by his son, named Ranghani, equally renowned
for his courage and dexterity.</p>

<p>On this occasion ten tame elephants were in attendance;
two were the property of an adjoining temple
(one of which had been caught but the year before,
yet it was now ready to assist in capturing others), four
belonged to the neighbouring chiefs, and the rest, including
the two which first entered the corral, were part
of the Government stud. Of the latter, one was of
great age, having been in the service of the Dutch
and English Governments in succession for upwards of
a century.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> The other, called by her keeper “Siribeddi,”
was about fifty years old, and distinguished for gentleness
and docility. She was a most accomplished decoy,
and evinced the utmost relish for the sport. Having
entered the corral noiselessly, carrying a mahout on her
shoulders with the headman of the noosers seated behind
him, she moved slowly along with a sly composure and
an assumed air of easy indifference; sauntering leisurely
in the direction of the captives, and halting now and then
to pluck a bunch of grass or a few leaves as she passed.
As she approached the herd, they put themselves in
motion to meet her, and the leader, having advanced in
front and passed his trunk gently over her head, turned
and paced slowly back to his dejected companions.
Siribeddi followed with the same listless step, and drew
herself up close behind him, thus affording the nooser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>an opportunity to stoop under her and slip the noose
over the hind foot of the wild one. The latter instantly
perceived his danger, shook off the rope, and turned to
attack the man. He would have suffered for his temerity
had not Siribeddi protected him by raising her trunk and
driving the assailant into the midst of the herd, when the
old man, being slightly wounded, was helped out of the
corral, and his son, Ranghani, took his place.</p>

<p>The herd again collected in a circle, with their heads
towards the centre. The largest male was singled out,
and two tame ones pushed boldly in, one on either side
of him, till the three stood nearly abreast. He made
no resistance, but betrayed his uneasiness by shifting
restlessly from foot to foot. Ranghani now crept up,
and, holding the rope open with both hands (its other
extremity being made fast to Siribeddi’s collar), and
watching the instant when the wild elephant lifted its
hind-foot, succeeded in passing the noose over its leg,
drew it close, and fled to the rear. The two tame
elephants instantly fell back, Siribeddi stretched the
rope to its full length, and, whilst she dragged out the
captive, her companion placed himself between her and
the herd to prevent any interference.</p>

<div class="caption">NOOSING WILD ELEPHANTS.</div>
</div>

<p>In order to tie him to a tree he had to be drawn
backwards some twenty or thirty yards, making furious
resistance, bellowing in terror, plunging on all sides, and
crushing the smaller timber, which bent like reeds beneath
his clumsy struggles. Siribeddi drew him steadily
after her, and wound the rope round the proper tree,
holding it all the time at its full tension, and stepping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>cautiously across it when, in order to give it a second
turn, it was necessary to pass between the tree and
the elephant. With a coil round the stem, however, it
was beyond her strength to haul the prisoner close up,
which was, nevertheless, necessary in order to make
him perfectly fast; but the second tame one, perceiving
the difficulty, returned from the herd, confronted the
struggling prisoner, pushed him shoulder to shoulder,
and head to head, forcing him backwards, whilst at
every step Siribeddi hauled in the slackened rope till she
brought him fairly up to the foot of the tree, where he
was made fast by the cooroowe people. A second noose
was then passed over the other hind-leg, and secured
like the first, both legs being afterwards hobbled together
by ropes made from the fibre of the kitool or
jaggery palm, which, being more flexible than that of
the coco nut, occasions less formidable ulcerations. The
two decoys then ranged themselves, as before, abreast
of the prisoner on either side, thus enabling Ranghani
to stoop under them and noose the two fore-feet as he
had already done the hind; and these ropes being made
fast to a tree in front, the capture was complete, and
the tame elephants and keepers withdrew to repeat the
operation on another of the herd.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p126.jpg" width="500" height="444" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As long as the tame ones stood beside him the poor
animal remained comparatively calm and almost passive
under his distress, but the moment they moved off,
and he was left utterly alone, he made the most surprising
efforts to set himself free and rejoin his companions.
He felt the ropes with his trunk and tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
to untie the numerous knots; he drew backwards to
liberate his fore-legs, then leaned forward to extricate
the hind ones, till every branch of the tall tree quivered
with his struggles. He screamed in anguish, with his
proboscis raised high in air, then falling on his side he
laid his head to the ground, first his cheek and then his
brow, and pressed down his doubled-in trunk as though
he would force it into the earth; then suddenly rising
he balanced himself on his forehead and fore-legs, holding
his hind-feet fairly off the ground. This scene of
distress continued some hours, with occasional pauses of
apparent stupor, after which the struggle was from time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to time renewed convulsively, and as if by some sudden
impulse; but at last the vain strife subsided, and the
poor animal remained perfectly motionless, the image
of exhaustion and despair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ranghani presented himself in front of
the Governor’s stage to claim the accustomed largesse
for tying the first elephant. He was rewarded by a
shower of rupees, and retired to resume his perilous
duties in the corral.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p127.jpg" width="500" height="355" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The rest of the herd were now in a state of pitiable
dejection, and pressed closely together as if under a
sense of common misfortune. For the most part they
stood at rest in a compact body, fretful and uneasy.
At intervals one more impatient than the rest would
move out a few steps to reconnoitre; the others would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
follow at first slowly, then at a quicker pace, and at last
the whole herd would rush off furiously to renew the
often-baffled attempt to storm the stockade.</p>

<p>There was a strange combination of the sublime and
the ridiculous in these abortive onsets; the appearance
of prodigious power in their ponderous limbs, coupled
with the almost ludicrous shuffle of their clumsy gait,
and the fury of their apparently resistless charge, converted
in an instant into timid retreat. They rushed
madly down the enclosure, their backs arched, their
tails extended, their ears spread, and their trunks raised
high above their heads, trumpeting and uttering shrill
screams, yet when one step further would have dashed
the opposing fence into fragments, they stopped short
on a few white rods being pointed at them through the
paling;<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> and, on catching the derisive shouts of the
crowd, they turned in utter discomfiture, and after an
objectless circle through the corral, they paced slowly
back to their melancholy halting-place in the shade.</p>

<p>The crowd, chiefly comprised of young men and boys,
exhibited astonishing nerve and composure at such
moments, rushing up to the point towards which the
elephants charged, pointing their wands at their trunks,
and keeping up the continual cry of <i>whoop! whoop!</i>
which invariably turned them to flight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>
<p>The second victim singled out from the herd was
secured in the same manner as the first. It was a
female. The tame ones forced themselves in on either
side as before, cutting her off from her companions,
whilst Ranghani stooped under them to attach the
fatal noose, and Siribeddi dragged her out amidst unavailing
struggles, when she was made fast by each leg
to the nearest group of strong trees. When the noose
was placed upon her fore-foot, she seized it with her
trunk and succeeded in carrying it to her mouth, where
she would speedily have severed it had not a tame elephant
interfered, and placing his foot on the rope
pressed it downwards out of her jaws. The individuals
who acted as leaders in the successive charges on the
palisades were always those selected by the noosers, and
the operation of tying each, from the first approaches of
the decoys, till the captive was left alone by the tree,
occupied on an average somewhat less than three-quarters
of an hour.</p>

<p>It is strange that in these encounters the wild elephants
made no attempt to attack or dislodge the mahouts
or the cooroowes, who rode on the tame ones. They
moved in the very midst of the herd, any individual in
which could in a moment have pulled the riders from
their seats; but no attempt was made to molest them.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p130.jpg" width="500" height="490" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As one after another their leaders were entrapped and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>forced away from them, the remainder of the group
evinced increased emotion and excitement; but whatever
may have been their sympathy for their lost companions,
their alarm seemed to prevent them at first
from following them to the trees to which they had
been tied. In passing them afterwards they sometimes
stopped, mutually entwined their trunks, lapped them
round each other’s limbs and neck, and exhibited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
most touching distress at their detention, but made no
attempt to disturb the cords that bound them.</p>

<p>The variety of disposition in the herd as evidenced
by difference of demeanour was very remarkable: some
submitted with comparatively little resistance; whilst
others in their fury dashed themselves on the ground with
a force sufficient to destroy any weaker animal. They
vented their rage upon every tree and plant within reach;
if small enough to be torn down, they levelled them with
their trunks, and stripping them of their leaves and
branches, tossed them wildly over their heads on all
sides. Some in their struggles made no noise, whilst
others bellowed and trumpeted furiously, then uttered
short convulsive screams, and at last, exhausted and
hopeless, gave vent to their anguish in low and piteous
moanings. Some, after a few violent efforts of this kind,
lay motionless on the ground, with no other indication of
suffering than the tears which suffused their eyes and
flowed incessantly. Others in all the vigour of their rage
exhibited the most surprising contortions; and to us who
had been accustomed to associate with the unwieldy bulk
of the elephant the idea that he must of necessity be
stiff and inflexible, the attitudes into which they forced
themselves were scarcely credible. I saw one lie with
the cheek pressed to the earth, and the fore-legs stretched
in front, whilst the body was twisted round till the hind
legs extended in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>It was astonishing that their trunks were not wounded
by the violence with which they flung them on all sides.
One twisted his proboscis into such fantastic shapes, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
it resembled the writhings of a gigantic worm; he coiled
it and uncoiled it with restless rapidity, suddenly unfolding
it to its full length, and coiling it up again like a
watch-spring. Another, which lay otherwise motionless
in all the stupor of hopeless anguish, slowly beat the
ground with the extremity of his trunk, as a man in
despair beats his knee with the palm of his hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p132.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="" />
</div>

<p>They displayed an amount of sensitiveness and delicacy
of touch in the foot, which was very remarkable in
a limb of such clumsy dimensions and protected by so
thick a covering. The noosers could always force them
to lift it from the ground by the gentlest touch of a leaf
or twig, apparently applied so as to tickle; but the imposition
of the rope was instantaneously perceived, and
if it could not be reached by the trunk the other foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
was applied to feel its position, and if possible remove it
before the noose could be drawn tight.</p>

<p>One practice was incessant with almost the entire
herd: in the intervals between their struggles they beat
the ground with their fore-feet, and taking up the dry
earth in a coil of the trunk, they flung it dexterously over
every part of their body. Even when lying down the
sand within reach was thus collected and scattered over
their limbs; then inserting the extremity of the trunk in
their mouths, they withdrew a quantity of water, which
they discharged over their backs, repeating the operation
again and again, till the dust was thoroughly saturated.
I was astonished at the quantity of water thus applied,
which was sufficient when the elephant, as was generally
the case, had worked the spot where he lay into a hollow,
to convert its surface into a coating of mud. Seeing that
the herd had been now twenty-four hours without access
to water of any kind, surrounded by watch-fires, and exhausted
by struggling and terror, the supply of moisture
an elephant is capable of containing in the receptacle attached
to his stomach must be very considerable.</p>

<p>The conduct of the tame ones during all these proceedings
was truly wonderful. They displayed the most
perfect conception of every movement, both of the object
to be attained, and of the means to accomplish it. They
manifested the utmost enjoyment in what was going on.
There was no ill-humour, no malignity in the spirit displayed,
in what was otherwise a heartless proceeding, but
they set about it in a way that showed a thorough relish
for it, as an agreeable pastime. Their caution was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
remarkable as their sagacity; there was no hurrying, no
confusion, they never ran foul of the ropes, were never in
the way of the animals already noosed; and amidst the
most violent struggles, when the tame ones had frequently
to step across the captives, they in no instance trampled
on them, or occasioned the slightest accident or annoyance.
So far from this, they saw intuitively a difficulty
or a danger, and addressed themselves unbidden to
remove it. In tying up one of the larger elephants, he
contrived before he could be hauled close up to the tree,
to walk once or twice round it, carrying the rope with
him; the decoy, perceiving the advantage he had thus
gained over the nooser, walked up of her own accord,
and pushed him backwards with her head, till she made
him unwind himself again; upon which the rope was
hauled tight and made fast. More than once, when a
wild one was extending his trunk, and would have intercepted
the rope about to be placed over his leg, Siribeddi,
by a sudden motion of her own trunk, pushed his aside,
and prevented him; and on one occasion, when successive
efforts had failed to put the noose over the fore-leg of
an elephant which was already secured by one foot, but
which wisely put the other to the ground as often as it
was attempted to pass the noose under it, I saw the
decoy watch her opportunity, and when his foot was again
raised, suddenly push in her own leg beneath it, and
hold it up till the noose was attached and drawn tight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p134a.jpg" width="500" height="318" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ATTITUDES OF CAPTURED ELEPHANTS.</div></div>

<p>One could almost fancy there was a display of dry
humour in the manner in which the decoys thus played
with the fears of the wild herd, and made light of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>efforts at resistance. When reluctant they shoved them
forward, when violent they drove them back; when the
wild ones threw themselves down, the tame ones butted
them with head and shoulders, and forced them up again.
And when it was necessary to keep them down, they
knelt upon them, and prevented them from rising, till the
ropes were secured.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p135.jpg" width="500" height="426" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At every moment of leisure they fanned themselves
with a bunch of leaves, and the graceful ease with which
an elephant uses his trunk on such occasions is very
striking. It is doubtless owing to the combination of a
circular with a horizontal movement in that flexible limb;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
but it is impossible to see an elephant fanning himself
without being struck by the singular elegance of motion
which he displays. The tame ones, too, indulged in the
luxury of dusting themselves with sand, by flinging it
from their trunks; but it was a curious illustration of
their delicate sagacity, that so long as the mahout was on
their necks, they confined themselves to flinging the dust
along their sides and stomach, as if aware, that to throw
it over their heads and back would cause annoyance to
their riders.</p>

<p>One of the decoys which rendered good service, and
was obviously held in special awe by the wild herd, was a
tusker belonging to Dehigame Raté-mahat-meya. It was
not that he used his tusks for purposes of offence, but he
was enabled to insinuate himself between two elephants
by wedging them in where he could not force his head;
besides which they assisted him in raising up the fallen
and refractory with greater ease. In some instances
where the intervention of the other decoys failed to
reduce a wild one to order, the mere presence and
approach of the tusker seemed to inspire fear, and insure
submission, without more active intervention.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it was the surprising qualities
exhibited by the tame elephants that cast the courage
and dexterity of the men into the shade, but even when
supported by the presence, the sagacity, and co-operation
of these wonderful creatures, the part sustained by the
noosers can bear no comparison with the address and
daring displayed by the <i>picador</i> and <i>matador</i> in a Spanish
bull-fight. They certainly possessed great quickness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
eye in watching the slightest movement of the elephant,
and great expertness in flinging the noose over its foot
and attaching it firmly before the animal could tear it off
with its trunk; but in all this they had the cover of the
decoys to conceal them; and their shelter behind which
to retreat. Apart from the services which, from their
prodigious strength, the tame elephants alone are capable
of rendering, in dragging out and securing the captives,
it is perfectly obvious that without their co-operation the
utmost prowess and dexterity of the hunters would not
avail nor embolden them, unsupported, to enter the corral
and ensnare and lead out a single captive.</p>

<p>Of the two tiny elephants which were entrapped, one
was about ten months old, the other somewhat more.
The smaller one had a little bolt head covered with
woolly brown hair, and was the most amusing and interesting
miniature imaginable. Both kept constantly with the
herd, trotting after them in every charge; when the
others stood at rest they ran in and out between the legs
of the older ones; and not their own mothers alone, but
every female in the group, caressed them in turn.</p>

<p>The dam of the youngest was the second elephant
singled out by the noosers, and as she was dragged along
by the decoys, the little creature kept by her side till she
was drawn close to the fatal tree. The men at first were
rather amused than otherwise by its anger; but they
found that it would not permit them to place the second
noose upon its mother; it ran between her and them, it
tried to seize the rope, it pushed them and struck them
with its little trunk, till they were forced to drive it back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
to the herd. It retreated slowly, shouting all the way,
and pausing at every step to look back. It then attached
itself to the largest female remaining in the group, and
placed itself across her fore legs, whilst she hung down
her trunk over its side and soothed and caressed it.
Here it continued moaning and lamenting, till the
noosers had left off securing its mother, when it instantly
returned to her side; but as it became troublesome
again, attacking every one who passed, it was at last tied
up by a rope to an adjoining tree, to which the other
young one was also tied. The second little one, equally
with its playmate, exhibited great affection for its dam;
it went willingly with its captor as far as the tree to which
she was fastened, and in passing her stretched out its
trunk and tried to rejoin her; but finding itself forced
along, it struggled and caught at every twig and branch
within its reach, screaming with grief and disappointment.</p>

<p>These two little creatures were the most vociferous of
the whole herd, their shouts were incessant, they struggled
to attack everyone within reach; and as their bodies were
more lithe and pliant than those of greater growth, their
contortions were quite wonderful. The most amusing
thing was, that in the midst of all their agony and affliction,
the little fellows seized on every article of food
that was thrown to them, and munched and roared simultaneously.</p>

<p>Amongst the last of the elephants noosed was the
<i>rogue</i>. Though far more savage than the others, he
joined in none of their charges and assaults on the
fences, as they uniformly drove him off and would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
permit him to enter their circle. When dragged past
another of his companions in misfortune, who was lying
exhausted on the ground, he flew upon him and attempted
to fasten his teeth in his head; this was the only instance
of viciousness which occurred during the progress of the
corral. When tied up and overpowered, he was at first
noisy and violent, but soon lay down peacefully, a sign,
according to the hunters, that his death was at hand.
Their prognostication proved to be correct; he continued
for about twelve hours to cover himself with dust like the
others, and to moisten it with water from his trunk; but
at length he sunk exhausted, and died so calmly, that
having been moving but a few moments before, his death
was only perceived by the myriads of black flies by which
his body was almost instantly covered, although not one
was visible a moment before.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> The Rodiyas were called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>in to loose from the tree the ropes that bound him, and
two tame elephants being harnessed to the dead body, it
was dragged to a distance without the corral.</p>

<p>When every wild elephant had been noosed and tied
up, the scene presented was truly oriental. From one to
two thousand natives, many of them in gaudy dresses
and armed with spears, crowded about the enclosures.
Their families too had collected from great distances to
see the spectacle; women, whose children clung like
little bronzed Cupids by their sides; and girls, many of
them in the graceful costume of that part of the country,—a
scarf, which, after having been brought round the
waist, is thrown over the left shoulder, leaving the right
arm and side free and uncovered.</p>

<p>At the foot of each tree was its captive elephant;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>some still struggling and writhing in feverish excitement,
whilst others, in exhaustion and despair, lay calm and
motionless, except that, from time to time, they heaped
fresh dust upon their heads. The mellow notes of a
Kandyan flute, which was played at a distance, had a
striking effect upon one or more of them; they turned
their heads in the direction from which the music came,
expanded their broad ears, and were evidently soothed
with the plaintive sound. The two little ones alone
still roared for freedom; they stamped their feet, and
blew clouds of dust over their shoulders, brandishing
their little trunks aloft, and threatened every one who
came within their reach.</p>

<p>At first the older ones, when secured, spurned every
offer of food, trampled it under foot, and turned haughtily
away. A few, however, as they became more composed,
could not resist the temptation of the juicy stems of the
plantain, but rolling them under foot, till they detached
the layers, they raised them in their trunks, and commenced
to chew them listlessly.</p>

<p>On the whole, whilst the sagacity, the composure, and
docility of the decoys were such as to excite lively
astonishment, it was not possible to withhold high admiration
from the calm and dignified demeanour of the
captives. Their entire bearing was at variance with the
representation made by some of the “sportsmen” who
harass them, that they are treacherous, savage, and
revengeful; when tormented by the guns of their persecutors,
they no doubt display their powers and sagacity
in efforts to retaliate or escape; but here their every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
movement was indicative of innocence and timidity.
After a struggle, in which they evinced no disposition to
violence or revenge, they submitted with the calmness
of despair. Their attitudes were pitiable, their grief was
most touching, and their low moaning went to the heart.
We could not have borne to witness their distress had their
capture been effected by the needless infliction of pain,
or had they been destined to ill-treatment afterwards.</p>

<p>It was now about two hours after noon, and the first
elephants that had entered the corral having been disposed
of, preparations were made to reopen the gate,
and drive in the other two herds, over which the watchers
were still keeping guard. The area of the inclosure was
cleared; and silence was again imposed on the crowds
who surrounded the corral. The bars that secured the
entrance were withdrawn, and every precaution repeated
as before; but as the space inside was now somewhat
trodden down, especially near the entrance, by the frequent
charges of the last herd, and as it was to be
apprehended that the others might be earlier alarmed
and retrace their steps, before the barricades could be
replaced, two tame ones were stationed inside to protect
the men to whom that duty was assigned.</p>

<p>All preliminaries being at length completed, the signal
was given; the beaters on the side most distant from
the corral closed in with tom-toms and discordant noises;
a hedge-fire of musketry was kept up in the rear of the
terrified elephants; thousands of voices urged them
forward; we heard the jungle crashing as they came on,
and at last they advanced through an opening amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
the trees, bearing down all before them like a charge of
locomotives. They were led by a huge female, nearly
nine feet high, after whom one half of the herd dashed
precipitately through the narrow entrance, but the rest,
turning suddenly towards the left, succeeded in forcing
the cordon of guards and making good their escape to
the forest.</p>

<p>No sooner had the others passed in through the gate,
than the tame elephants stepped forward from either side,
and before the herd could return from the further end
of the enclosure, the bars were replaced, the entrance
closed, and the men in charge glided outside the stockade.
The elephants which had previously been made prisoners
within exhibited intense excitement as the fresh din
arose around them; they started to their feet, and
stretched their trunks in the direction whence they
winded the scent of the herd in its headlong flight; and
as the latter rushed past, they renewed their struggles
to get free and follow. It is not possible to imagine
anything more exciting than the spectacle which the
wild ones presented careering round the corral, uttering
piercing screams, with heads erect and trunks aloft, the
very emblems of rage and perplexity, of power and helplessness.</p>

<p>Along with those which entered at the second drive
was one that evidently belonged to another herd, and
had been separated from it in the <i>melee</i> when the latter
effected their escape, and, as usual, his new companions
in misfortune drove him off indignantly as often as he
attempted to approach them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>The demeanour of those taken in the second drive
differed materially from that of the preceding captives,
who, having entered the corral in darkness, suddenly
found themselves girt with fire and smoke, and beset by
hideous sounds and sights on every side, and were
speedily reduced by fear to stupour and submission—whereas,
the second herd having passed into the enclosure
by daylight, and its area being trodden down in
many places, could clearly discern the fences, and were
consequently alarmed and enraged at their confinement.
They were thus as restless as the others had been calm,
and so much more vigorous in their assaults that, on one
occasion, their courageous leader, undaunted by the
multitude of white wands thrust towards her, was only
driven back from the stockade by a hunter hurling a
blazing flambeau at her head. Her attitude as she stood
repulsed, but still irresolute, was a study for a painter.
Her eye dilated, her ears expanded, her back arched
like a tiger, and her fore-foot in air, whilst she uttered
those hideous screams that are imperfectly described by
the term “<i>trumpeting</i>.”</p>

<p>Although repeatedly passing by the unfortunates from
the former drove, the new herd seemed to take no
friendly notice of them; they halted inquiringly for a
minute, and then resumed their career round the corral,
and once or twice in their headlong flight they rushed
madly over the bodies of the prostrate captives as they
lay in their misery on the ground.</p>

<p>It was evening before the new captives had grown
wearied with their furious and repeated charges, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
stood still in the centre of the corral collected into a
terrified and motionless group. The fires were then relighted,
the guards redoubled by the addition of the
beaters, who were now relieved from the duty of watching
in the forest, and the spectators retired to their bungalows
for the night.</p>

<p>The business of the <i>third day</i> began by noosing and
tying up the new captives, and the first sought out was
their magnificent leader. Siribeddi and the tame tusker
having forced themselves on either side of her, a boy in
the service of the rata-mahat-meya succeeded in attaching
a rope to her hind-foot. Siribeddi moved off, but
feeling her strength insufficient to drag the reluctant
prize, she went down on her fore-knees, so as to add the
full weight of her body to the pull. The tusker, seeing
her difficulty, placed himself in front of the prisoner, and
forced her backwards, step by step, till his companion
brought her fairly up to the tree, and wound the rope
round the stem. Though overpowered by fear, she
showed the fullest sense of the nature of the danger she
had to apprehend. She kept her head turned towards
the noosers, and tried to step in advance of the decoys;
in spite of all their efforts, she tore off the first noose
from her fore-leg, and placing it under her foot, snapped
it into fathom lengths. When finally secured, her writhings
were extraordinary. She doubled in her head under
her chest, till she lay as round as a hedgehog, and rising
again, stood on her fore-feet, and lifting her hind-feet off
the ground, she wrung them from side to side, till the
great tree above her trembled in every branch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>Before proceeding to catch the remainder we requested
that the smaller trees and jungle, which partially obstructed
our view, might be broken away, being no
longer essential to screen the entrance to the corral; and
five of the tame elephants were brought up for the purpose.
They felt the strength of each tree with their
trunks, then swaying it backwards and forwards, by
pushing it with their foreheads, they watched the opportunity
when it was in full swing to raise their fore-feet
against the stem, and bear it down to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> Then
tearing off the festoons of climbing plants, and trampling
down the smaller branches and brushwood, they pitched
them with their tusks, piling them into heaps along the
side of the fence.</p>

<p>Amongst the last that was secured was the solitary
individual belonging to the fugitive herd. When the
tame one attempted to drag him backwards from the
tree near which he was noosed, he laid hold of it with
his trunk and lay down on his side immoveable. The
temple tusker and another were ordered up to assist, and
it required the combined efforts of the three elephants
to force him along. When dragged to the place at which
he was to be tied up, he continued the contest with
desperation, and to prevent the second noose being
placed on his foot, he sat down on his haunches, almost
in the attitude of the “Florentine Boar,” keeping his
hind-feet beneath him, and defending his fore-feet with
his trunk, with which he flung back the rope as often as
it was attempted to attach it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>
<p>When overpowered and made fast, his grief was most
affecting; his violence sunk to utter prostration, and he
lay on the ground, uttering choking cries, with tears
trickling down his cheeks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p147.jpg" width="500" height="446" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The last operation of the corral was that of slackening
the ropes, and marching each captive elephant down to
the river between two tame ones. This was effected
very simply. A decoy, with a strong collar round its
neck, stood on either side of the wild one, on which a
similar collar was formed by successive coils of coco-nut
rope; and then, connecting the three collars together,
the prisoner was effectually made safe between his two
guards. During this operation, it was curious to see how
the tame elephant, from time to time, used its trunk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
shield the arm of its rider, and ward off the trunk of
the prisoner, who resisted the placing the rope round his
neck. This done, the nooses were removed from his
feet, and he was marched off to the river, in which he
and his companions were allowed to bathe; a privilege
of which all availed themselves eagerly. Each was then
made fast to a tree in the forest, and keepers being
assigned to him, with a retinue of leaf-cutters, he was
plentifully supplied with his favourite food, and left to
the care and tuition of his new masters.</p>

<p>Returning from a spectacle such as I have attempted
to describe, one cannot help feeling how immeasurably
it exceeds in interest those royal battues where timid
deer are driven in crowds to unresisting slaughter; or
those vaunted “wild sports” the amusement of which
appears to be in proportion to the effusion of blood.
Here the only display of power was the imposition of
restraint; and though considerable mortality often occurs
amongst the animals caught, the infliction of pain, so
far from being an incident of the operation, is cautiously
avoided, from its tendency to enrage, the policy of the
captor being to conciliate and soothe. The whole scene
exhibits the most marvellous example of the voluntary
alliance of animal sagacity and instinct in active cooperation
with human intelligence and courage; and
nothing else in nature, not even the chase of the whale,
can afford so vivid an illustration of the sovereignty of
man over brute creation even when confronted with force
in its most stupendous embodiment.</p>

<p>Of the two young elephants which were taken in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
corral, the smallest was sent down to my house at
Colombo, where he became a general favourite with the
whole family. He attached himself especially to the
coachman, who had a little shed erected for him near his
own quarters at the stables. But his favourite resort
was the kitchen, where he received a daily allowance
of milk and plantains, and picked up other delicacies
besides. He was innocent and playful in the extreme,
and when walking in the grounds he would trot up to
me, twine his little trunk round my arm, and coax me
to take him to the fruit-trees. In the evening the grass
cutters now and then indulged him by permitting him to
carry home a load of fodder for the horses, on which
occasions he assumed an air of gravity that was highly
amusing, showing that he was deeply impressed with the
importance and responsibility of the service entrusted to
him. Being sometimes permitted to enter the dining-room,
and helped to fruit at dessert, he at last learned his
way to the sideboard; and on more than one occasion,
having stolen in during the absence of the servants, he
made a clear sweep of the wine-glasses and china in his
endeavours to reach a basket of oranges. For these and
similar pranks we were at last forced to put him away.
He was sent to the Government stud, at Colombo,
where he was affectionately received and adopted by
Siribeddi, and he now takes his turn of public duty in
the department of the Commissioner of Roads.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
<small><small>CONDUCT IN CAPTIVITY.</small></small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> idea prevailed in ancient times, and obtains even at
the present day, that the Indian elephant surpasses that
of Africa in sagacity and tractability, and consequently
in capacity for training, so as to render its services more
available to man. There does not appear to me to be
sufficient ground for this conclusion. It originated, in
all probability, in the first impressions created by the
accounts of the elephant brought back by the Greeks
after the Indian expedition of Alexander, and above all
by the descriptions of Aristotle, whose knowledge of
the animal was derived exclusively from the East. The
belief was perpetuated by later writers, especially
Diodorus Siculus, who says the elephants of India
excelled those of Africa in mental capacity not less than
in magnitude and strength:—Οἳ ταῖς τε ἀλκαῖς καὶ ταῖς
τοῦ σώματος ῥωμαῖς πολὺ προέχουσι τῶν ἐν τῇ Λιβύῃ
γινομένων. (<span class="smcap">Diod. Sic.</span> ii. c. 16.) A long interval elapsed
before the elephant of Africa, and its capabilities,
became known in Europe. The first elephants brought
to Greece by Antipater, were from India, as were also
those introduced by Pyrrhus into Italy. Taught by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
example, the Carthaginians undertook to employ African
elephants in war. Jugurtha led them against Metellus,
and Juba against Cæsar; but from inexperienced and
deficient training, they proved less effective than the
elephants of India,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> and the historians of these times
ascribed to inferiority of race that which was but the
result of insufficient education.</p>

<p>It must, however, be remembered that the elephants
which, at a later period, astonished the Romans by their
sagacity, and whose performances in the amphitheatre
have been described by Ælian and Pliny, were brought
from Africa, and acquired their accomplishments from
European instructors;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> a sufficient proof that under
equally favourable auspices the African species are
capable of developing similar docility and powers with
those of India. It is one of the facts from which the
inferiority of the Negro race has been inferred, that
they alone, of all the nations amongst whom the elephant
is found, have never manifested ability to domesticate
it; and even as regards the more highly developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>races who inhabited the valley of the Nile, it is observable
that the elephant is nowhere to be found amongst
the animals figured on the monuments of ancient Egypt,
whilst the camelopard, the lion, and even the hippopotamus
are represented. And although in later times the
knowledge of the art of training appears to have existed
under the Ptolemies, and on the southern shores of the
Mediterranean, it admits of no doubt that it was communicated
by the more accomplished natives of India
who had settled there.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>Another favourite doctrine of the earlier visitors to
the East seems to me to be equally fallacious; <span class="smcap">Pyrard</span>,
<span class="smcap">Bernier</span>, <span class="smcap">Phillipe</span>, <span class="smcap">Thevenot</span>, and other travellers in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, proclaimed the
superiority of the elephant of Ceylon, in size, strength,
and sagacity, above those of all other parts of India;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>and <span class="smcap">Tavernier</span> in particular is supposed to have stated
that if a Ceylon elephant be introduced amongst those
bred in any other place, by an instinct of nature they
do him homage by laying their trunks to the ground,
and raising them reverentially. This passage has been
so repeatedly quoted in works on Ceylon that it has
passed into an aphorism, and is always adduced as a
testimony to the surpassing intelligence of the elephants
of that island; although a reference to the original shows
that Tavernier’s observations are not only fanciful in
themselves, but are restricted to the supposed excellence
of the Ceylon animal <i>in war</i>.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> This estimate of the
superiority of the elephant of Ceylon, if it ever prevailed
in India, was not current there at a very early period;
for in the <i>Ramayana</i>, which is probably the oldest epic
in the world, the stud of Dasartha, the king of Ayodhya,
was supplied with elephants from the Himalaya and
the Vindhya Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> I have had no opportunity
of testing by personal observation the justice of the
assumption; but from all that I have heard of the ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>phants
of the continent, and seen of those of Ceylon,
I have reason to conclude that the difference, if not
imaginary, is exceptional, and must have arisen in particular
and individual instances, from more judicious or
elaborate instruction.</p>

<p>The earliest knowledge of the elephant in Europe and
the West, was derived from the conspicuous position
assigned to it in the wars of the East: in India, from the
remotest antiquity, it formed one of the most picturesque,
if not the most effective, features in the armies of the
native princes.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> It is more than probable that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>earliest attempts to take and train the elephant, were
with a view to military uses, and that the art was perpetuated
in later times to gratify the pride of the eastern
kings, and sustain the pomp of their processions.</p>

<p>An impression prevails even to the present day, that
the process of training is tedious and difficult, and the
reduction of a full-grown elephant to obedience, slow
and troublesome in the extreme.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> In both particulars,
however, the contrary is the truth. The training as it
prevails in Ceylon is simple, and the conformity and
obedience of the animal are developed with singular
rapidity. For the first three days, or till they will eat
freely, which they seldom do in a less time, the newly-captured
elephants are allowed to remain perfectly quiet;
and, if practicable, a tame elephant is tied near them to
give the wild ones confidence. Where many elephants
are being trained at once, it is customary to put each
new captive between the stalls of half-tamed ones, when
it soon takes to its food. This stage being attained,
training commences by placing tame elephants on either
side. The “cooroowe vidahn,” or the head of the stables,
stands in front of the wild elephants holding a long stick
with a sharp iron point. Two men are then stationed
one on either side, assisted by the tame elephants, and
each holding a <i>hendoo</i> or crook<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> towards the wild one’s
trunk, whilst one or two others rub their hands over his
back, keeping up all the while a soothing and plaintive
chaunt, interlarded with endearing epithets, such as “ho!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>my son,” or “ho! my father,” or “my mother,” as may
be applicable to the age and sex of the captive. The
elephant is at first furious, and strikes in all directions
with his trunk; but the men in front receiving all these
blows on the points of their weapons, the extremity of
the trunk becomes so sore that the animal curls it up
close, and seldom afterwards attempts to use it offensively.
The first dread of man’s power being thus established,
the process of taking him to bathe between
two tame elephants is greatly facilitated, and by lengthening
the neck rope, and drawing the feet together
as close as possible, the process of laying him down
in the water is finally accomplished by the keepers
pressing the sharp point of their hendoos over the backbone.</p>

<p>For many days the roaring and resistance which
attend the operation are considerable, and it often requires
the sagacious interference of the tame elephants
to control the refractory wild ones. It soon, however,
becomes practicable to leave the latter alone, only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>taking them to and from the stall by the aid of a decoy.
This step lasts, under ordinary treatment, for about three
weeks, when an elephant may be taken alone with his
legs hobbled, and a man walking backwards in front
with the point of the hendoo always presented to the
elephant’s head, and a keeper with an iron crook at
each ear. On getting into the water, the fear of being
pricked on his tender back induces him to lie down
directly on the crook being only held over him <i>in terrorem</i>.
Once this point has been achieved, the further
process of taming is dependent upon the disposition of
the creature.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>The greatest care is requisite, and daily medicines are
applied to heal the fearful wounds on the legs which
even the softest ropes occasion. This is the great difficulty
of training; for the wounds fester grievously, and
months and sometimes years will elapse before an elephant
will allow his feet to be touched without indications
of alarm and anger.</p>

<p>The observation has been frequently made that the
elephants most vicious and troublesome to tame, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>the most worthless when tamed, are those distinguished
by a thin trunk and flabby pendulous ears. The period
of tuition does not appear to be influenced by the size
or strength of the animals: some of the smallest give
the greatest amount of trouble; whereas, in the instance
of the two largest that have been taken in Ceylon within
the last thirty years, both were docile in a remarkable
degree. One in particular, which was caught and trained
by Mr. Cripps, when Government agent, in the Seven
Korles, fed from the hand the first night it was secured,
and in a very few days evinced pleasure on being patted
on the head.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> There is none so obstinate, not even a
<i>rogue</i>, that may not, when kindly and patiently treated,
be eventually conciliated and reconciled.</p>

<p>The males are generally more unmanageable than the
females, and in both an inclination to lie down to rest
is regarded as a favourable symptom of approaching
tractability, some of the most resolute having been
known to stand for months together, even during sleep.
Those which are the most obstinate and violent at first
are the soonest and most effectually subdued, and generally
prove permanently docile and submissive. But
those which are sullen or morose, although they may not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>provoke chastisement by their viciousness, are always
slower in being trained, and are rarely to be trusted in
after-life.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>But whatever may be its natural gentleness and
docility, the temper of an elephant is seldom to be implicitly
relied on in a state of captivity and coercion.
The most amenable are subject to occasional fits of
stubbornness; and even after years of submission, irritability
and resentment will sometimes unaccountably
manifest themselves. It may be that the restraints and
severer discipline of training have not been entirely forgotten;
or that incidents which in ordinary health would
be productive of no demonstration whatever, may lead,
in moments of temporary illness, to fretfulness and anger.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>
<p>The knowledge of this infirmity led to the popular belief
recorded by <span class="smcap">Phile</span>, that the elephant had <i>two hearts</i>,
under the respective influences of which it evinced ferocity
or gentleness; subdued by the one to habitual
tractability and obedience, but occasionally roused by
the other to displays of rage and resistance.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>In the process of training, the presence of the tame
ones can generally be dispensed with after two months,
and the captive may then be ridden by the driver alone;
and after three or four months he may, so far as regards
docility, be entrusted with labour; but it is undesirable,
and even involves the risk of its life, to work an elephant
too soon; it has frequently happened that a valuable
animal has laid down and died the first time it was tried
in harness, from what the natives believe to be “broken
heart,”—certainly without any cause inferable from injury
or previous disease.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> It is observable, that till a captured
elephant begins to relish food, and grow fat upon it, he
becomes so fretted by work, that it kills him in an incredibly
short space of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>The first employment to which an elephant is put is to
tread clay in a brick-field, or to draw a waggon in double
harness with a tame companion. But the work in which
the display of sagacity renders his labour of the highest
value, is that which involves the moving of heavy materials;
and hence in dragging and piling timber, or conveying
stones<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> for the construction of retaining walls and
the approaches to bridges his services in an unopened
country are of the utmost importance. When roads are
to be constructed along the face of steep declivities, and
the space is so contracted that risk is incurred either of
the working elephant falling over the precipice or of rocks
slipping down from above, not only are the measures to
which he resorts the most judicious and reasonable that
could be devised, but if urged by his keeper to adopt any
other, he manifests a reluctance sufficient to show that he
has balanced in his own mind the comparative advantages
of each. An elephant appears on all occasions to comprehend
the purpose and object that he is expected to
promote, and hence he voluntarily executes a variety of
details without any guidance whatever from his keeper.
This is one characteristic in which this animal manifests
a superiority over the horse; although an elephant’s
strength in proportion to its weight is not so great as that
of the latter.</p>

<p>His minute motions when engrossed by such operations,
the activity of his eye, and the earnestness of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>attitudes, can only be comprehended by being seen. In
moving timber and masses of rock his trunk is the instrument
on which he mainly relies, but those which have
tusks turn them to good account. To get a weighty
stone out of a hollow an elephant will kneel down so as
to apply the pressure of his head to move it upwards,
then steadying it with one foot till he can raise himself,
he will apply a fold of his trunk to shift it to its place,
and fit it accurately in position: this done, he will step
round to view it on either side, and adjust it with due
precision. He appears to gauge his task by his eye, and
to form a judgment whether the weight be proportionate
to his strength. If doubtful of his own power, he hesitates
and halts, and if urged against his will, he roars and
shows temper.</p>

<p>In clearing an opening through forest land, the power
of the African elephant, and the strength ascribed to him
by a recent traveller, as displayed in uprooting trees, have
never been equalled or approached by anything I have
seen of the elephant in Ceylon<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> or heard of them in India.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>Of course much must depend on the nature of the timber
and the moisture of the soil: thus a strong tree on the
verge of a swamp may be overthrown with greater ease
than a small and low one in parched and solid ground.
I have seen no “tree” deserving the name, nothing but
jungle and brushwood, thrown down by the mere movement
of an elephant without some special exertion of
force. But he is by no means fond of gratuitously tasking
his strength; and food being so abundant that he
obtains it without an effort, it is not altogether apparent,
even were he able to do so, why he should assail “the
largest trees in the forest,” and encumber his own haunts
with their broken stems; especially as there is scarcely
anything which an elephant dislikes more than venturing
amongst fallen timber.</p>

<p>A tree of twelve inches in diameter resisted successfully
the most strenuous struggles of the largest elephant
I ever saw led to it; and when directed by their keepers to
clear away jungle, the removal of even a small tree or a
healthy young coco-nut palm is a matter both of time and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>exertion. Hence the services of an elephant are of much
less value in clearing a forest than in dragging and piling
felled timber. But in the latter occupation he manifests
an intelligence and dexterity which is surprising to a
stranger, because the sameness of the operation enables
the animal to go on for hours disposing of log after log,
almost without a hint or direction from his attendant.
For example, two elephants employed in piling ebony
and satinwood in the yards attached to the commissariat
stores at Colombo, were so accustomed to their work,
that they were able to accomplish it with equal precision
and with greater rapidity than if it had been done by
dock-labourers. When the pile attained a certain height,
and they were no longer able by their conjoint efforts to
raise one of the heavy logs of ebony to the summit, they
had been taught to lean two pieces against the heap, up
the incline of which they gently rolled the remaining
logs, and placed them trimly on the top.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that in their occupations “elephants
are to a surprising extent the creatures of habit,”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
that their movements are altogether mechanical, and that
“they are annoyed by any deviation from their accustomed
practice, and resent any constrained departure
from the regularity of their course.” So far as my own
observation goes, this is incorrect; and I am assured by
officers of experience, that in regard to changing his
treatment, his hours or his occupation, an elephant requires
no more consideration than a horse, but exhibits
the same pliancy and facility.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>
<p>At one point, however, the utility of the elephant stops
short. Such is the intelligence and earnestness he displays
in work, which he seems to conduct almost without
supervision, that it has been assumed<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> that he would
continue his labour, and accomplish his given task, as
well in the absence of his keeper as during his presence.
But here his innate love of ease displays itself, and if the
eye of his attendant be withdrawn, the moment he has
finished the thing immediately in hand, he will stroll away
lazily, to browse or enjoy the luxury of fanning himself
and blowing dust over his back.</p>

<p>The means of punishing so powerful an animal is a
question of difficulty to his attendants. Force being
almost inapplicable, they try to work on his passions and
feelings, by such expedients as altering the nature of his
food or withholding it altogether for a time. On such
occasions the demeanour of the creature will sometimes
evince a sense of humiliation as well as of discontent.
In some parts of India it is customary, in dealing with
offenders, to stop their allowance of sugar canes or of
jaggery; or to restrain them from eating their own share
of fodder and leaves till their companions shall have
finished; and in such cases the consciousness of degradation,
betrayed by the looks and attitudes of the culprit,
is quite sufficient to identify him, and to excite a feeling
of sympathy and commiseration.</p>

<p>The elephant’s obedience to his keeper is the result of
affection, as well as of fear; and although his attachment
becomes so strong that an elephant in Ceylon has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>known to remain out all night, without food, rather than
abandon his mahout, lying intoxicated in the jungle, yet
he manifests little difficulty in yielding the same submission
to a new driver in the event of a change of attendants.
This is opposed to the popular belief that “the
elephant cherishes such an enduring remembrance of his
old mahout, that he cannot easily be brought to obey a
stranger.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> In the extensive establishments of the
Ceylon Government, the keepers are changed without
hesitation, and the animals, when equally kindly treated,
are usually found to be as tractable and obedient to their
new driver as to the old, so soon as they have become
familiarised with his voice.</p>

<p>This is not, however, invariably the case; and Mr.
Cripps, who had remarkable opportunities for observing
the habits of the elephant in Ceylon, mentioned to me
an instance in which one of a singularly stubborn disposition
occasioned some inconvenience after the death of
its keeper, by refusing to obey any other, till its attendants
bethought them of a child about twelve years old,
in a distant village, where the animal had been formerly
picketed, and to whom it had displayed much attachment.
The child was sent for; and on its arrival the elephant,
as anticipated, manifested extreme satisfaction, and was
managed with ease, till by degrees it became reconciled
to the presence of a new superintendent.</p>

<p>It has been said that the mahouts die young, owing to
some supposed injury to the spinal column from the peculiar
motion of the elephant; but this remark does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>apply to those in Ceylon, who are healthy, and as long-lived
as other men. If the motion of the elephant be
thus injurious, that of the camel must be still more so;
yet we never hear of early death ascribed to this cause
by the Arabs.</p>

<p>The voice of the keeper, with a very limited vocabulary
of articulate sounds, serves almost alone to guide the
elephant in his domestic occupations.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Sir <span class="smcap">Everard
Home</span>, from an examination of the muscular fibres in
the drum of an elephant’s ear, came to the conclusion,
that notwithstanding the distinctness and power of his
perception of sounds at a greater distance than other
animals, he was insensible to their harmonious modulation
and destitute of a musical ear.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> But Professor
<span class="smcap">Harrison</span>, in a paper read before the Royal Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>Academy in 1847, has stated that on a careful examination
of the head of an elephant which he had dissected,
he could “see no evidence of the muscular structure of
the <i>membrana tympani</i> so accurately described by Sir
<span class="smcap">E. Home</span>.” Sir <span class="smcap">Everard’s</span> deduction, I may observe,
is clearly inconsistent with the fact that the power of
two elephants may be combined by singing to them a
measured chant, somewhat resembling a sailor’s capstan
song; and in labour of a particular kind, such as hauling
a stone with ropes, they will thus move conjointly a
weight to which their divided strength would be unequal.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>Nothing can more strongly exhibit the impulse to
obedience in the elephant, than the patience with which,
at the order of his keeper, he swallows the nauseous
medicines of the native elephant-doctors; and it is impossible
to witness the fortitude with which, without
shrinking, he submits to excruciating surgical operations
for the removal of tumours and ulcers, without conceiving
a vivid impression of his gentleness and intelligence.
Dr. <span class="smcap">Davy</span> when in Ceylon was consulted about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>an elephant in the Government stud, which was suffering
from a deep, burrowing sore in the back, just over the
back-bone, and this had long resisted the treatment
ordinarily employed. He recommended the use of the
knife, that vent might be given to the accumulated
matter, but no one of the attendants was competent to
undertake the operation. “Being assured,” he continues,
“that the creature would behave well, I undertook it
myself. The elephant was not bound, but was made to
kneel down at his keeper’s command—and with an amputating
knife, using all my force, I made the incision
required through the tough integuments. The elephant
did not flinch, but rather inclined towards me when
using the knife; and merely uttered a low, and as it were
suppressed, groan. In short, he behaved as like a human
being as possible, as if conscious (as I believe he was),
that the operation was for his good, and the pain
unavoidable.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p>Obedience to the orders of his keepers is not, however,
to be assumed as the result of a uniform perception of
the object to be attained by compliance; and we cannot
but remember the touching incident which took
place during the slaughter of the elephant at Exeter
Change in 1826, when, after receiving ineffectually upwards
of 120 balls in various parts of his body, he
turned his face to his assailants on hearing the voice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>his keeper, and knelt down at the accustomed word of
command, so as to bring his forehead within view of the
rifles.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>The working elephant is always a delicate animal,
and requires watchfulness and care. As a beast of
burden it is unsatisfactory; for although in point of
mere strength there is scarcely any weight which could
be conveniently placed on it that it could not carry, it
is difficult to pack the load without causing abrasions
that afterwards ulcerate. The skin is easily chafed by
harness, especially in wet weather. During either long
droughts or too much moisture, an elephant’s feet
become liable to sores, that render it non-effective for
months. Many attempts have been made to provide
some protection for the sole of the foot, but from the
extreme weight and the peculiar mode of planting the
foot, they have all been unsuccessful. The eyes are also
liable to frequent inflammations, and the skill of the
native elephant-doctors, which has been renowned since
the time of Ælian, is nowhere more strikingly displayed
than in the successful treatment of such attacks.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> In
Ceylon, the murrain among the cattle is of frequent
occurrence, and carries off great numbers of animals,
wild as well as tame. In such visitations the elephants
suffer severely, not only those at liberty in the forest, but
those carefully tended in the Government stables. Out of
a stud of about 40 attached to the department of the
Commission of Roads, the deaths between 1841 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>1849 were on an average <i>four</i> in each year, and this was
nearly doubled in those years when murrain prevailed.</p>

<p>Of 240 elephants, employed in the public departments
of the Ceylon Government, which died in twenty-five
years, from 1831 to 1856, the length of time that each
lived in captivity has only been recorded in the instances
of 138. Of these there died:—</p>

<p>Of the entire, twenty-three were females and eleven
males.</p>

<p>The ages of those that died could not be accurately
stated, owing to the circumstance of their having been
captured in corral. Two only were tuskers. Towards
keeping the stud in health, nothing has been found so
conducive as regularly bathing the elephants, and
giving them the opportunity to stand with their feet in
water, or in moistened earth.</p>

<p>Elephants are said to be afflicted with tooth-ache;
their tushes have likewise been found with symptoms of
internal perforation by some parasite, and the natives
assert that, in their agony, the animals have been known
to break them off short.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> I have never heard of the
teeth themselves being so affected, and it is just possible
that the operation of shedding and the subsequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>decay of the milk-tushes, may have in some instances
been accompanied by incidents that gave rise to this
story. At the same time the probabilities are in favour
of its being true. <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span> committed himself to the
statement that the tusks of the elephant have no attachments
to connect them with the pulp lodged in the
cavity at their base, from which the peculiar modification
of dentine, known as “ivory” is secreted;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> and hence,
by inference, that they would be devoid of sensation.
But independently of the fact that ivory is permeated
by tubes so fine that at their origin from the pulpy
cavity they do not exceed the 1/15000 part of an inch in
diameter, <span class="smcap">Owen</span> had the tusk and pulp of the great
elephant which died at the Zoological Gardens in
London in 1847 longitudinally divided, and found that,
“although the pulp could be easily detached from the
inner surface of the cavity, it was not without a certain
resistance; and when the edges of the co-adapted pulp
and tusk were examined by a strong lens, the filamentary
processes from the outer surface of the former
could be seen stretching, as they were drawn from the
dentinal tubes, before they broke. These filaments are
so minute, he adds, that to the naked eye the detached
surface of the pulp seems to be entire; and hence
<span class="smcap">Cuvier</span> was deceived into supposing that there was no
organic connexion between the pulp and the ivory. But
if, as there seems no reason to doubt, these delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>nervous processes traverse the tusk by means of the
numerous tubes already described, if attacked by caries
the pain occasioned to the elephant would be excruciating.</p>

<p>As to maintaining a stud of elephants for the purposes
to which they are now assigned in Ceylon, there may
be a question on the score of prudence and economy.
In the wild and unopened parts of the country, where
rivers are to be forded, and forests are only traversed
by jungle paths, their labour is of value, in certain
contingencies, in the conveyance of stores, and in the
earlier operations for the construction of fords and
rough bridges of timber. But in more highly civilised
districts, and wherever macadamised roads admit of the
employment of horses and oxen for draught, I apprehend
that the services of the elephant might, with advantage,
be gradually reduced, if not altogether dispensed
with.</p>

<p>The love of the elephant for coolness and shade
renders it at all times more or less impatient of work
in the sun, and every moment of leisure it can snatch
is employed in covering its back with dust, or fanning
itself to diminish the annoyance of the insects and heat.
From the tenderness of the skin and its liability to sores,
the labour in which the elephant can most advantageously
be employed is that of draught; but the reluctance of
horses to meet or pass them renders it difficult to work
them with safety on frequented roads. Besides, were
the full load which an elephant is capable of drawing,
proportionally to its muscular strength, to be placed
upon waggons of corresponding dimension, the injury to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
roads from the extra weight would be such that the wear
and tear of the highways and bridges would prove too
costly to be borne. On the other hand, by restricting it
to a somewhat more manageable quantity, and by limiting
the weight, as at present, to about <i>one ton and a half</i>,
it is doubtful whether an elephant performs so much
more work than could be done by a horse or by bullocks,
as to compensate for the greater cost of his feeding and
attendance.</p>

<p>Add to this, that from accidents and other causes,
from ulcerations of the skin, and illnesses of many kinds,
the elephant is so often invalided, that the actual cost
of its labour, when at work, is very considerably enhanced.
Exclusive of the salaries of higher officers
attached to the Government establishments, and other
permanent charges, the expenses of an elephant, looking
only to the wages of its attendants and the cost of its
food and medicines, varies from <i>three shillings to four
shillings and sixpence</i> per diem, according to its size and
class.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> Taking the average at three shillings and nine-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>pence,
and calculating that hardly any individual works
more than four days out of seven, the charge for each
day so employed would amount to <i>six shillings and sixpence</i>.
The keep per day of a powerful dray-horse,
working five days in the week, would not exceed half-a-crown,
and two such would unquestionably do more
work than any elephant under the present system. I
do not know whether it be from a comparative calculation
of this kind that the strength of the elephant establishments
in Ceylon has been gradually diminished
of late years, but in the department of the Commissioner
of Roads, the stud, which formerly numbered
upwards of sixty elephants, was reduced, some years
ago, to thirty-six, and is at present less than half that
number.</p>

<p>The fallacy of the supposed reluctance of the elephant
to breed in captivity has been demonstrated by many
recent authorities; but with the exception of the birth
of young elephants at Rome, as mentioned by <span class="smcap">Ælian</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>the only instances that I am aware of their actually producing
young under such circumstances, took place in
Ceylon. Both parents had been for several years attached
to the stud of the Commissioner of Roads, and
in 1844 the female, whilst engaged in dragging a waggon,
gave birth to a still-born calf. Some years before, an
elephant that had been captured by Mr. Cripps, dropped
a female calf, which he succeeded in rearing. As usual,
the little one became the pet of the keepers; but as it
increased in growth, it exhibited the utmost violence
when thwarted; striking out with its hind-feet, throwing
itself headlong on the ground, and pressing its trunk
against any opposing object.</p>

<p>The duration of life in the elephant has been from the
remotest times a matter of uncertainty and speculation.
Aristotle says it was reputed to live from two to three
hundred years,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and modern zoologists have assigned to
it an age very little less; <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span><a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> allots two hundred
and <span class="smcap">De Blainville</span><a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> one hundred and twenty. The
only attempt which I know of to establish a period historically
or physiologically is that of <span class="smcap">Fleurens</span>, who has
advanced an ingenious theory on the subject in his
treatise “<i>De la Longévité Humaine</i>.” He assumes the
sum total of life in all animals to be equivalent to five
times the number of years requisite to perfect their
growth and development;—and he adopts as evidence
of the period at which growth ceases, the final consolidation
of the bones with their <i>epiphyses</i>; which in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>young consist of cartilages; but in the adult become
uniformly osseous and solid. So long as the epiphyses
are distinct from the bones, the growth of the animal
is proceeding, but it ceases so soon as the consolidation
is complete. In man, according to <span class="smcap">Fleurens</span>, this consummation
takes place at 20 years of age, in the horse
at 5, in the dog at 2; so that conformably to this theory
the respective normal age for each would be 100 years
for man, 25 for the horse, and 10 for a dog. As a datum
for his conclusion, <span class="smcap">Fleurens</span> cites the instance of one
young elephant in which, at 26 years old, the epiphyses
were still distinct, whereas in another, which died at 31,
they were firm and adherent. Hence he draws the inference
that the period of completed solidification is
thirty years, and consequently that the normal age of the
elephant is <i>one hundred and fifty</i>.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Singhalese the ancient fable of the
elephant attaining to the age of two or three hundred
years still prevails; but the Europeans, and those in immediate
charge of tame ones, entertain the opinion that
the duration of life for about <i>seventy</i> years is common
both to man and the elephant; and that before the arrival
of the latter period, symptoms of debility and decay
ordinarily begin to manifest themselves. Still instances
are not wanting in Ceylon of trained decoys that have
lived for more than double the reputed period in actual
servitude. One employed by Mr. Cripps in the Seven
Korles was represented by the cooroowe people to have
served the king of Kandy in the same capacity sixty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>years before; and amongst the papers left by Colonel
Robertson (son to the historian of “Charles V.”), who
held a command in Ceylon in 1799, shortly after the
capture of the island by the British, I have found a
memorandum showing that a decoy was then attached to
the elephant establishment at Matura, which the records
proved to have served under the Dutch during the entire
period of their occupation (extending to upwards of one
hundred and forty years); and it was said to have been
found in the stables by the Dutch on the expulsion of
the Portuguese in 1656.</p>

<p>It is perhaps from this popular belief in their almost
illimitable age, that the natives generally assert that the
body of a dead elephant is seldom or never to be discovered
in the woods. And certain it is that frequenters
of the forest with whom I have conversed, whether
European or Singhalese, are consistent in their assurances
that they have never found the remains of an
elephant that had died a natural death. One chief, the
Wannyah of the Trincomalie district, told a friend of
mine, that once after a severe murrain, which had swept
the province, he found the carcasses of elephants that
had died of the disease. On the other hand, a European
gentleman, who for thirty-six years without intermission
has been living in the jungle, ascending to the summits
of mountains in the prosecution of the trigonometrical
survey, and penetrating valleys in tracing roads and
opening means of communication,—one, too, who has
made the habits of the wild elephant a subject of constant
observation and study,—has often expressed to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
his astonishment that after seeing many thousands of
living elephants in all possible situations, he had never
yet found a single skeleton of a dead one, except of those
which had fallen by the rifle.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested that the bones of the elephant
may be so porous and spongy as to disappear in consequence
of an early decomposition; but this remark
would not apply to the grinders or to the tusks; besides
which, the inference is at variance with the fact, that not
only the horns and teeth, but entire skeletons of deer,
are frequently found in the districts inhabited by the
elephant.</p>

<p>The natives, to account for this popular belief, declare
that the survivors of the herd bury such of their companions
as die a natural death.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> It is curious that this
belief was current also amongst the Greeks of the Lower
Empire; and Phile, writing early in the fourteenth
century, not only describes the younger elephants as
tending the wounded, but as burying the dead:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Ὅταν δ’ ἐπιστῇ τῆς τελευτῆς ὁ χρόνος</div>
<div class="line">Κοινοῦ τέλους ἄμυναν ὁ ξένος φέρει.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>The Singhalese have a further superstition in relation
to the close of life in the elephant: they believe that, on
feeling the approach of dissolution, he repairs to a solitary
valley, and there resigns himself to death. A native
who accompanied Mr. Cripps, when hunting, in the
forests of Anarajapoora, intimated to him that he was
then in the immediate vicinity of the spot “<i>to which
the elephants come to die</i>,” but that it was so mysteriously
concealed, that although every one believed in its existence,
no one had ever succeeded in penetrating to it.
At the corral which I have described at Kornegalle, in
1847, Dehigame, one of the Kandyan chiefs, assured me
it was the universal belief of his countrymen, that the
elephants, when about to die, resorted to a valley in
Saffragam, among the mountains to the east of Adam’s
Peak, which was reached by a narrow pass with walls
of rock on either side, and that there, by the side of a
lake of clear water, they took their last repose.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> It was
not without interest that I afterwards recognised this
tradition in the story of <i>Sinbad of the Sea</i>, who in his
Seventh Voyage, after conveying the presents of Haroun
al Raschid to the king of Serendib, is wrecked on his
return from Ceylon, and sold as a slave to a master who
employs him in shooting elephants for the sake of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>ivory; till one day the tree on which he was stationed
having been uprooted by one of the herd, he fell senseless
to the ground, and the great elephant approaching
wound his trunk around him and carried him away,
ceasing not to proceed until he had taken him to a place
where, his terror having subsided, <i>he found himself
amongst the bones of elephants, and knew that this was
their burial place</i>.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> It is curious to find this legend of
Ceylon in what has, not inaptly, been described as the
“Arabian Odyssey” of Sinbad; the original of which
evidently embodies the romantic recitals of the sailors
returning from the navigation of the Indian Seas, in the

<h3>APPENDIX TO CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As Ælian’s</span> work on <i>the Nature of Animals</i> has never, I
believe, been republished in any English version, and the
passage in relation to the training and performance of
elephants is so pertinent to the present inquiry, I venture to
subjoin a translation of the 11th chapter of his 2nd book.</p>

<p>“Of the cleverness of the elephant I have spoken elsewhere,
and likewise of the manner of hunting. I have mentioned
these things, a few out of the many which others have stated;
but for the present I purpose to speak of their musical feeling,
their tractability, and facility in learning what it is difficult
for even a human being to acquire, much less a beast, hitherto
so wild:—such as to dance, as is done on the stage; to walk
with a measured gait; to listen to the melody of the flute and
to perceive the difference of sounds, that, being pitched low
lead to a slow movement, or high to a quick one; all this the
elephant learns and understands, and is accurate withal,
and makes no mistake. Thus has Nature formed him not
only the greatest in size, but the most gentle and the most
easily taught. Now if I were going to write about the
tractability and aptitude to learn amongst those of India,
Æthiopia, and Libya, I should probably appear to be concocting
a tale and acting the braggart, or to be telling a
falsehood respecting the nature of the animal founded on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
mere report, all which it behoves a philosopher, and most of
all one who is an ardent lover of truth, not to do. But what
I have seen myself, and what others have described as having
occurred at Rome, this I have chosen to relate, selecting a few
facts out of many, to show the particular nature of those
creatures. The elephant when tamed is an animal most
gentle and most easily led to do whatever he is directed.
And by way of showing honour to time, I will first narrate
events of the oldest date. Cæsar Germanicus, the nephew of
Tiberius, exhibited once a public show, wherein there were
many full-grown elephants, male and female, and some of
their breed born in this country. When their limbs were
beginning to become firm, a person familiar with such animals
instructed them by a strange and surpassing method of
teaching; using only gentleness and kindness, and adding to
his mild lessons the bait of pleasant and varied food. By
this means he led them by degrees to throw off all wildness,
and, as it were, to desert to a state of civilisation, conducting
themselves in a manner almost human. He taught them
neither to be excited on hearing the pipe, nor to be disturbed
by the beat of drum, but to be soothed by the sounds of
the reed, and to endure unmusical noises and the clatter of
feet from persons while marching; and they were trained to
feel no fear of a mass of men, nor to be enraged at the
infliction of blows, not even when compelled to twist their
limbs and to bend them like a stage dancer, and this too
although endowed with strength and might. And there is in
this a very noble addition to nature, not to conduct themselves
in a disorderly manner and disobediently towards the instructions
of man; for after the dancing-master had made them
expert, and they had learnt their lessons accurately, they did
not belie the labour of his instruction whenever a necessity
and opportunity called upon them to exhibit what they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
been taught. For the whole troop came forward from this
and that side of the theatre, and divided themselves into
parties; they advanced walking with a mincing gait and
exhibiting in their whole body and persons the manners of a
beau, clothed in the flowery dresses of dancers; and on the
ballet-master giving a signal with his voice, they fell into line
and went round in a circle, and if it were requisite to deploy
they did so. They ornamented the floor of the stage by
throwing flowers upon it, and this they did in moderation
and sparingly, and straightway they beat a measure with
their feet and kept time together.</p>

<p>“Now that Damon and Spintharus and Aristoxenus and
Xenophilus and Philoxenus and others should know music
excellently well, and for their cleverness be ranked amongst
the few, is indeed a thing of wonder, but not incredible nor
contrary at all to reason. For this reason, that a <i>man</i> is a
rational animal, and the recipient of mind and intelligence.
But that a jointless animal (ἄναρθρον) should understand
rhythm and melody, and preserve a gesture, and not deviate
from a measured movement, and fulfil the requirements of
those who laid down instructions, these are gifts of nature, I
think, and a peculiarity in every way astounding. Added to
these there were things enough to drive the spectator out of
his senses; when the strewn rushes and other materials for
beds on the ground were placed on the sand of the theatre,
and they received stuffed mattresses such as belonged to rich
houses, and variegated bed-coverings, and goblets were placed
there very expensive, and bowls of gold and silver, and in
them a great quantity of water; and tables were placed there
of sweet-smelling wood and ivory very superb: and upon them
flesh meats and loaves enough to fill the stomachs of animals
the most voracious. When the preparations were completed
and abundant, the banqueters came forward, six male and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
equal number of female elephants; the former had on a male
dress and the latter a female; and on a signal being given
they stretched forward their trunks in a subdued manner, and
took their food in great moderation, and not one of them appeared
to be gluttonous greedy, or to snatch at a greater portion,
as did the Persian mentioned by Xenophon. And when
it was requisite to drink, a bowl was placed by the side of
each; and inhaling with their trunks they took a draught
very orderly; and then they scattered the drink about in fun;
but not as in insult. Many other acts of a similar kind, both
clever and astonishing, have persons described, relating to the
peculiarities of these animals, and I saw them writing letters
on Roman tablets with their trunks, neither looking awry nor
turning aside. The hand, however, of the teacher was placed
so as to be a guide in the formation of the letters; and while
it was writing the animal kept its eye fixed down in an
accomplished and scholarlike manner.”</p>

1849, P. 144 <i>note</i>. The original
description of <span class="smcap">Temminck</span> is as follows:
</p>
<p>
“Elephas Sumatranus, <i>Nob.</i> ressemble,
par la forme générale du
crâne, à l’éléphant du continent de
l’Asie; mais la partie libre des intermaxillaires
est beaucoup plus
courte et plus étroite; les cavités
nasales sont beaucoup moins larges;
l’espace entre les orbites des yeux
est plus étroit; la partie postérieure
du crâne au contraire est plus large
que dans l’espèce du continent.
</p>
<p>
“Les mâchelières se rapprochent,
par la forme de leur couronne,
plutôt de l’espèce asiatique que de
celle qui est propre à l’Afrique;
c’est-à-dire que leur couronne offre
la forme de rubans ondoyés et non
pas en losange; mais ces rubans
sont de la largeur de ceux qu’on voit
à la couronne des dents de l’éléphant
d’Afrique; ils sont conséquemment
moins nombreux que dans celui du
continent de l’Asie. Les dimensions
de ces rubans, dans la direction
d’avant en arrière, comparées à celles
prises dans la direction transversale
et latérale, sont en raison de 3 ou 4
à 1; tandis que dans l’éléphant du
continent elles sont comme 4 ou
6 à 1. La longueur totale de six de
ces rubans, dans l’espèce nouvelle
de Sumatra, ainsi que dans celle
d’Afrique, est d’environ 12 centimètres,
tandis que cette longueur
n’est que de 8 à 10 centimètres dans
l’espèce du continent de l’Asie.
</p>
<p>
“Les autres formes ostéologiques
sont à peu près les mêmes dans les
trois espèces; mais il y a différence
dans le nombre des os dont le
squelette se compose, ainsi que le
tableau comparatif ci-joint l’éprouve.
</p>
<p>
“L’<i>elephas Africanus</i> a 7 vertèbres
du cou, 21 vert. dorsales, 3
lombaires, 4 sacrées et 26 caudales;
21 paires de côtes, dont 6 vraies
et 15 fausses. L’<i>elephas Indicus</i>
a 7 vertèbres du cou, 19 dorsales,
3 lombaires, 5 sacrées et 34 caudales,
19 paires de côtes, dont 6
vraies et 3 fausses. L’<i>elephas Sumatranus</i>
a 7 vertèbres du cou, 20
dorsales, 3 lombaires, 4 sacrées et
34 caudales; 20 paires de côtes,
dont 6 vraies et 14 fausses.
</p>
<p>
“Ces caractères ont été constatés
sur trois squelettes de l’espèce nouvelle,
un mâle et une femelle adultes
et un jeune mâle. Nous n’avons
pas encore été à même de nous
procurer la dépouille de cette
espèce.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">7</span></a> <span class="smcap">M. Ad. Pictet</span> has availed himself
of the love of the elephant for
water, to found on it a solution of the
long-contested question as to the etymology
of the word “elephant,”—a
term which, whilst it has passed into
almost every dialect of the West, is
scarcely to be traced in any language
of Asia. The Greek ἐλέφας, to which
we are immediately indebted for it,
did not originally mean the animal,
but, as early as the time of Homer,
was applied only to its tusks, and signified
<i>ivory</i>. <span class="smcap">Bochart</span> has sought
for a Semitic origin, and seizing on
the Arabic <i>fil</i>, and prefixing the article
<i>al</i>, suggests <i>alfil</i>, akin to ἐλεφ; but
rejecting this, <span class="smcap">Bochart</span> himself resorts
to the Hebrew eleph, an “ox”—and
this conjecture derives a certain degree
of countenance from the fact that the
Romans, when they obtained their first
sight of the elephant in the army of
Pyrrhus, in Lucania, called it the
<i>Luca bos</i>. But the αντος is still unaccounted
for: and <span class="smcap">Pott</span> has sought to
remove the difficulty by introducing
the Arabic <i>hindi</i>, Indian, thus making
<i>eleph hindi</i>, “<i>bos Indicus</i>.” The conversion
of <i>hindi</i> into αντος is an obstacle,
but here the example of “tamarind”
comes to aid; <i>tamar hindi</i>, the “Indian
date,” which in mediæval Greek
forms ταμἄρεντι. A theory of <span class="smcap">Benary</span>,
that ἐλέφας might be compounded of
the Arabic <i>al</i>, and <i>ibha</i>, a Sanskrit
name for the elephant, is exposed to
still greater etymological exception.
<span class="smcap">Pictet’s</span> solution is, that in the Sanskrit
epics “the King of Elephants,”
who has the distinction of carrying the
god Indra, is called <i>airavata</i> or <i>airavana</i>,
a modification of <i>airavanta</i>
“son of the ocean,” which again comes
from <i>iravat</i>, “abounding in water.”
“Nous aurions donc ainsi, comme corrélatif
du grec ἐλέφαντα, une ancienne
forme, <i>âirâvanta</i> ou <i>âilâvanta</i>, affaiblie
plus tard en <i>âirâvata</i> ou <i>âirâvana</i>....
On connaît la prédilection de
l’éléphant pour le voisinage des fleuves,
et son amour pour l’eau, dont l’abondance
est nécessaire à son bien-être.”
This Sanskrit name, <span class="smcap">Pictet</span> supposes,
may have been carried to the West by
the Phœnicians, who were the purveyors
of ivory from India; and, from
the Greek, the Latins derived <i>elephas</i>,
which passed into the modern languages
of Italy, Germany, and France.
But it is curious that the Spaniards
acquired from the Moors their Arabic
term for ivory, <i>marfil</i>, and the Portuguese
<i>marfim</i>; and that the Scandinavians,
probably from their early expeditions
to the Mediterranean, adopted
<i>fill</i> as their name for the elephant
itself, and <i>fil-bein</i> for ivory; in Danish,
<i>fils-ben</i>. (See <i>Journ. Asiat.</i> 1843,
t. xliii. p. 133.) The Spaniards of South
America call the palm which produces
the vegetable ivory (<i>Phytelephas macrocarpa</i>)
<i>Palma de marfil</i>, and the
nut itself, <i>marfil vegetal</i>.
</p>
<p>
Since the above was written Gooneratné
Modliar, the Singhalese Interpreter
to the Supreme Court at Colombo,
has supplied me with another
conjecture, that the word elephant may
possibly be traced to the Singhalese
name of the animal, <i>alia</i>, which means
literally, “the huge one.” <i>Alia</i>, he
adds, is not a derivation from Sanskrit
or Pali, but belongs to a dialect more
ancient than either.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">10</span></a> In some parts of Bengal, where
elephants were formerly troublesome
(especially near the wilds of Ramgur),
the natives got rid of them by mixing
a preparation of the poisonous Nepal
root called <i>dakra</i> in balls of grain, and
other materials, of which the animal is
fond. In Cuttack, above fifty years
ago, mineral poison was laid for them
in the same way, and the carcases of
eighty were found which had been
killed thus. (<i>Asiat. Res.</i> xv. 183.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">11</span></a> The number of elephants has been
similarly reduced throughout the south
of India, and as in the advancing
course of enclosure and cultivation,
the area within which they will be
driven must become more and more
contracted, the conjecture is by no
means problematical, that before many
generations shall have passed away, the
species may become extinct in Asia.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">12</span></a> The annual importation of ivory
into Great Britain alone, for the last
few years, has been about <i>one million</i>
pounds; which, taking the average
weight of a tusk at sixty pounds, would
require the slaughter of 8,333 male
elephants.
</p>
<p>
But of this quantity the importation
from Ceylon has generally averaged
only five or six hundred weight; which,
making allowance for the lightness of
the tusks, would not involve the destruction
of more than seven or eight
in each year. At the same time, this
does not fairly represent the annual
number of tuskers shot in Ceylon, not
only because a portion of the ivory
finds its way to China and to other
places, but because the chiefs and
Buddhist priests have a passion for collecting
tusks, and the finest and largest
are to be found ornamenting their
temples and private dwellings. The
Chinese profess that for their exquisite
carvings the ivory of Ceylon excels all
other, both in density of texture and in
delicacy of tint; but in the European
market, the ivory of Africa, from its
more distinct graining, and other causes,
obtains a higher price.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">14</span></a> The old fallacy is still renewed
that the elephant sheds his tusks.
<span class="smcap">Ælian</span> says he drops them once in ten
years (lib. xiv. c. 5); and <span class="smcap">Pliny</span> repeats
the story, adding that, when dropped,
the elephants hide them under ground
(lib. viii.), whence <span class="smcap">Shaw</span> says, in his
<i>Zoology</i>, “they are frequently found in
the woods,” and exported from Africa
(vol. i. p. 213); and Sir <span class="smcap">W. Jardine</span>
in the <i>Naturalist’s Library</i> (vol. ix.
p. 110), says, “the tusks are shed about
the twelfth or thirteenth year.” This
is erroneous: after losing the first pair,
or, as they are called, the “milk tusks,”
which drop in consequence of the absorption
of their roots, when the animal
is extremely young, the second pair
acquire their full size, and become the
“permanent tusks,” which are never
shed.</p></div>

myself seen the greatest was taken from
an elephant killed by Sir Victor Brooke
Bart. at the Hassanoor Hills, in Coimbatore
in 1863. It measured 8 feet in
length, and when placed on end two
men each 6 feet high can with ease
stand side by side under the curved extremity.
It is 1 ft. 6 in. in circumference
at the base and weighs 110 lbs.
This remarkable tusk is now in the
museum at Colebrooke Park in the
county Fermanagh. Its companion,
owing to disease, is a distorted lump
of ivory; an almost shapeless mass
weighing 60 lbs. The life-long agony
endured by the poor animal who bore
it must have been frightful in the extreme.
Notwithstanding the inferiority
in weight of the Ceylon tusks, as
compared with those of the elephant
of India, it would, I think, be precipitate
to draw the inference that the
size of the former was uniformly and
naturally less than that of the latter.
The truth I believe to be, that if
permitted to grow to maturity, the
tusks of the one would, in all probability,
equal those of the other; but, so
eager is the search for ivory in Ceylon,
that a tusker, when once observed in
a herd, is followed up with such vigilant
impatience, that he is almost invariably
shot before attaining his full
growth. General <span class="smcap">De Lima</span>, when returning
from the governorship of the
Portuguese settlements at Mozambique,
told me, in 1848, that he had
been requested to procure two tusks of
the largest size, and straightest possible
shape, which were to be formed into a
cross to surmount the high altar of the
cathedral at Goa: he succeeded in his
commission, and sent two, one of which
was 180 pounds’ and the other 170
pounds’ weight, with the slightest possible
curve. In a periodical entitled
<i>The Friend</i>, published in Ceylon, it is
stated in the volume for 1837 that the
officers belonging to the ships Quorrah
and Alburhak, engaged in the Niger
Expedition, were shown by a native
king two tusks, each two feet and a half
in circumference at the base, eight feet
long, and weighing upwards of 200
pounds. (Vol. i. p. 225.) <span class="smcap">Broderip</span>,
in his <i>Zoological Recreations</i>, p. 255,
says a tusk of 350 pounds’ weight was
sold at Amsterdam, but he does not
quote his authority. <span class="smcap">Petherick</span> in his
<i>Account of Egypt, Soudan</i>, &amp;c. says
that in Central Africa the size of tusks
differs in different latitudes, those towards
the north being shorter, thicker,
less hollow, and heavier than those of the
south. Thus a tusk from the Nouaer,
Dinka, or Shilook tribes will weigh
120 lbs., while one from Bari would
weigh only 70 lbs. or 80 lbs. “Indeed,”
he adds, “I have known a tusk from
Nouaer to weigh 185 lbs., its length
being <i>seven feet two inches</i>, and its
greatest thickness at the base <i>nine</i>
inches.” (<span class="smcap">Petherick</span>, p. 418.) Sir
S. Baker, in his explorations of the
White Nile, saw monster tusks of 160
lbs.; and one in the possession of a
trader weighed 172 lbs. (<i>The Albert
Nyanza</i>, vol. i. p. 273.)</p></div>

gives the following account of a fight
between a Ceylon elephant and two
bulls, which took place at Saragossa:—‘The
elephant was walking quietly
about the arena when the first bull
was released and rushed at it with all
his might. The elephant received his
antagonist with great coolness, and
threw him down with the utmost ease.
The bull rose again and made two
more attacks, which the elephant resented
by killing him with his tusks.
The conqueror did not seem in the
least excited, but quietly drank some
water offered by his keeper, and ate
several ears of Indian corn. A second
bull was then released, and in a few
minutes suffered the same fate as the
first.’” (<i>Globe</i>, Nov. 9, 1864.) The

a thrust</i> of his tusks.”</p></div>

of the author leaves the problem
scarcely less obscure than before.
Struck with the mere <i>supplemental</i>
presence of the tusks, the absence of
all apparent use serving to distinguish
them from the <i>essential</i> organs of the
creature, Dr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span> concludes that
their production is a process incident,
but not ancillary, to other important
ends, especially connected with the
vital functions of the trunk and the
marvellous motive powers inherent to
it; his conjecture is, that they are
“a species of safety valve of the animal
œconomy,”—and that “they owe their
development to the predominance of the
senses of touch and smell, conjointly
with the muscular motions of which
the exercise of these is accompanied.”
“Had there been no proboscis,” he
thinks, “there would have been no supplementary
appendages,—the former
creates the latter.” (Pp. 246, 271.)</p></div>

<p>
Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Bell</span>, in his essay on
<i>The Hand and its Mechanism</i>, which
forms one of the “Bridgewater Treatises,”
has exhibited the reasons deducible
from organisation, which show
the incapacity of the elephant to <i>spring</i>
or <i>leap</i> like the horse and other animals
whose structure is designed to facilitate
agility and speed. In them the various
bones of the shoulder and fore limbs,
especially the clavicle and humerus, are
set at such an angle, that the shock in
descending is modified, and the joints
and sockets protected from the injury
occasioned by concussion. But in the
elephant, where the weight of the body
is immense, the bones of the leg, in
order to present solidity and strength
to sustain it, are built in one firm and
perpendicular column; instead of being
placed somewhat obliquely at their
points of contact. Thus whilst the
force of the weight in descending is
broken and distributed by this arrangement
in the case of the horse; it would
be so concentrated in the elephant as to
endanger every joint from the toe to
the shoulder.

<p>
The writer says, “an elephant descending
a bank of too acute an angle to
admit of his walking down it direct,
(which, were he to attempt, his huge
body, soon disarranging the centre of
gravity, would certainly topple over,)
proceeds thus. His first manœuvre is
to kneel down close to the edge of the
declivity, placing his chest to the
ground: one fore leg is then cautiously
passed a short way down the slope; and
if there is no natural protection to afford
a firm footing, he speedily forms one
by stamping into the soil if moist, or
kicking out a footing if dry. This
point gained, the other fore leg is
brought down in the same way; and
performs the same work, a little in
advance of the first; which is thus at
liberty to move lower still. Then, first
one and then the second of the hind
legs is carefully drawn over the side,
and the hind feet in turn occupy the
resting-places previously used and left
by the fore ones. The course, however,
in such precipitous ground is not straight
from top to bottom, but slopes along
the face of the bank, descending till the
animal gains the level below. This an
elephant has done, at an angle of 45
degrees, carrying a <i>howdah</i>, its occupant,
his attendant, and sporting apparatus;
and in a much less time than
it takes to describe the operation.” I
have observed that an elephant in descending
a declivity uses his knees, on
the side next the bank; and his feet
on the lower side only.

Selbourne</i>, philosophising on the fact
which had fallen under his own notice
of this indiscriminate suckling of the
young of one animal by the parent of
another, is disposed to ascribe it to a
selfish feeling; the pleasure and relief
of having its distended teats drawn by
this intervention. He notices the circumstance
of a leveret having been thus
nursed by a cat, whose kittens had
been recently drowned; and observes
that “this strange affection was probably
occasioned by that desiderium,
those tender maternal feelings, which
the loss of her kittens had awakened
in her breast; and by the complacency
and ease she derived to herself from
procuring her teats to be drawn, which
were too much distended with milk;
till from habit she became as much delighted
with this foundling as if it had
been her real offspring. This incident
is no bad solution of that strange circumstance
which grave historians, as
well as the poets, assert of exposed
children being sometimes nurtured by
female wild beasts that probably had
lost their young. For it is not one
whit more marvellous that Romulus
and Remus in their infant state should

when a male elephant in a quarrel about

becomes furious and mad, killing every
living creature, be it man or beast;
and in this state is called <i>ronkedor</i>, an
object of greater terror to a traveller
than a hundred wild ones.” (P. 142.)
In another passage, p. 164, he is called

<i>ronquedue</i>. <span class="smcap">Wolf</span> does not give
“<i>ronkedor</i>” as a term peculiar to that

elephant, materials are of course abundant
in the indestructible remains of
the animal: but the study of the intestines,
and the dissection of the softer
parts by comparative anatomists in
Europe, have been up to the present
time beset by difficulties. These arise
not alone from the rarity of subjects,
but even in cases where elephants have
died in these countries, decomposition
interposes, and before the thorough
examination of so vast a body can be
satisfactorily completed, the great mass
falls into putrefaction.

The principal English authorities are
<i>An Anatomical Account of the Elephant
accidentally burnt in Dublin</i>,
by <span class="smcap">A. Molyneux</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1696; which is
probably a reprint of a letter on the same
subject in the library of Trinity College,
Dublin, addressed by A. Moulin to Sir
William Petty, Lond. 1682. There are
also some papers communicated to Sir
Hans Sloane, and afterwards published
in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of
the year 1710, by Dr. <span class="smcap">P. Blair</span>, who
had an opportunity of dissecting an
elephant which died at Dundee in 1708.
The latter writer observes that, “notwithstanding
the vast interest attaching
to the elephant in all ages, yet has its
body been hitherto very little subjected
to anatomical inquiries;” and he laments
that the rapid decomposition of
the carcase, and other causes, had
interposed obstacles to the scrutiny of
the subject he was so fortunate as to
find access to.
</p>
<p>
In 1723 Dr. <span class="smcap">Wm. Stuckley</span> published
<i>Some Anatomical Observations
made upon the Dissection of an Elephant</i>;
but each of the above essays is
necessarily unsatisfactory, and little has
since been done to supply their defects.
One of the latest and most valuable
contributions to the subject, is a paper
read before the Royal Irish Academy,
on the 18th of Feb. 1847, by Professor
<span class="smcap">Harrison</span>, who had the opportunity of
dissecting an Indian elephant which
died of acute fever; but the examination,
so far as he has made it public,
extends only to the cranium, the brain,
and the proboscis, the larynx, trachea,
and œsophagus. An essential service
would be rendered to science if some
sportsman in Ceylon, or some of the
officers connected with the elephant
establishment there, would take the
trouble to forward the carcase of a
young one to England in a state fit for
dissection.

<i>Postscriptum.</i>—I am happy to say
that a young elephant, carefully preserved

in Ceylon, and forwarded to
Prof. Owen, of the British Museum, by
the joint exertions of <span class="smcap">M. Diard</span> and
Major <span class="smcap">Skinner</span>. An opportunity has
thus been afforded of which science
will reap the advantage, of devoting a

at the orifice of the stomach.
At the cardiac end, which is very
narrow and pointed at the extremity,
the lining is thick and glandular, and is
thrown into transverse folds, of which
five are broad and nine narrow. That
nearest the orifice of the œsophagus is
the broadest, and appears to act occasionally

twenty-five guineas for the destruction
of an elephant which infested the Rajawallé
coffee plantation, in the vicinity
of Kandy. Its object seemed to be less
the search for food, than the satisfying
of its curiosity and the gratification of
its passion for mischief. Mr. <span class="smcap">Tytler</span>,
the proprietor, states that it frequented
the jungle near the estate, whence it
was its custom to sally forth at night
for the pleasure of pulling down buildings
and trees, “and it seemed to have
taken a spite at the pipes of the waterworks,
the pillars of which it several
times broke down—its latest fancy
being to wrench off the taps.” This
elephant has since been shot.</p></div>

not addicted to what is called “sport,”
the statement of these wholesale slaughters
is calculated to excite surprise and
curiosity as to the nature of a passion
that impels men to self-exposure and
privation, in a pursuit which presents
nothing but the monotonous recurrence
of scenes of blood and suffering. Sir <span class="smcap">S.
Baker</span>, who has recently published,
under the title of “<i>The Rifle and the
Hound in Ceylon</i>,” an account of his
exploits in the forest, gives us the
assurance that “<i>all real sportsmen are
tender-hearted men, who shun cruelty
to an animal, and are easily moved
by a tale of distress</i>,” and that although
man is naturally bloodthirsty,
and a beast of prey by instinct, yet
that the true sportsman is distinguished
from the rest of the human race by
his “<i>love of nature and of noble scenery</i>.”
In support of this pretension
to a gentler nature than the rest of
mankind, the author proceeds to attest
his own abhorrence of cruelty by narrating
the sufferings of an old hound,
which, although “toothless,” he cheered
on to assail a boar at bay, but the poor
dog recoiled “covered with blood, cut
nearly in half, with a wound fourteen
inches in length, from the lower part
of the belly, passing up the flank, completely
severing the muscles of the
hind leg, and extending up the spine;
his hind leg having the appearance of
being nearly off.” In this state, forgetful
of the character he had so lately
given of the true sportsman, as a lover
of nature and a hater of cruelty, he
encouraged “the poor old dog,” as he
calls him, to resume the fight with the
boar, which lasted for an hour, when
he managed to call the dogs off; and,
perfectly exhausted, the mangled hound
crawled out of the jungle with several
additional wounds, including a severe
gash in his throat. “He fell from
exhaustion, and we made a litter with
two poles and a horsecloth to carry
him home.” (P. 314.) If such were
the habitual enjoyments of this class of
sportsmen, their motiveless massacres
would admit of no manly justification.
In comparison with them one is disposed
to regard almost with favour the
exploits of a hunter like Major <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>,
who is said to have applied the value
of the ivory obtained from his encounters
towards the purchase of his successive
regimental commissions, and
had, therefore, an object, however disproportionate,
in his slaughter of 1,400
elephants.
</p>
<p>
One gentleman in Ceylon, not less
distinguished for his genuine kindness
of heart, than for his marvellous success
in shooting elephants, avowed to
me that the eagerness with which he
found himself impelled to pursue them
had often excited surprise in his own
mind; and although he had never read
the theory of Lord Kames, or the
speculations of Vicesimus Knox, he
had come to the conclusion that the
passion thus excited within him was a
remnant of the hunter’s instinct, with
which man was originally endowed to
enable him, by the chase, to support
existence in a state of nature, and
which, though rendered dormant by
civilisation, had not been utterly eradicated.
</p>
<p>
This theory is at least more consistent
and intelligible than the “love
of nature and scenery,” sentimentally
propounded by the author quoted
above.</p></div>

in this region of the head was known
to the ancients, and <span class="smcap">Pliny</span>, describing
a combat of elephants in the amphitheatre
at Rome, says, that one was
slain by a single blow, “pilum sub
oculo adactum, in vitalia capitis venerat.”
(Lib. viii. c. 7.) Notwithstanding
the comparative facility of access
to the brain afforded at this spot, an
ordinary leaden bullet is not certain
to penetrate, and frequently becomes
flattened. The hunters, to counteract
this, are accustomed to harden the ball,
by the introduction of a small portion
of type-metal along with the lead.</p></div>

that the ball either passes over the
brain, or lodges in the immensely solid
bones and cartilages that contain the
roots of the tusks.... The brain
of the African species, he says, rests
upon a plate of bone exactly above the
roots of the upper grinders and is thus
wonderfully protected from a front shot,
as it lies so low that the ball passes over
it when the elephant raises his head,
which he invariably does when in anger,
until close to the object of his attack....
I had always held the opinion
that the African elephant might be
killed with the same facility as that of
Ceylon <i>by a forehead shot</i>; but I have
found by much experience that I was
entirely wrong and that although by
chance an African elephant may be
killed by the front shot, it is the exception
to the rule.” (<i>The Albert Nyanza</i>,

<p><a name="Footnote_107_107" id="Footnote_107_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_107_107"><span class="label">107</span></a> In Mr. <span class="smcap">Gordon Cumming’s</span> account
of a <i>Hunter’s Life in South Africa</i>,
there is a narrative of his pursuit of a
wounded elephant which he had lamed
by lodging a ball in its shoulder-blade.
It limped slowly towards a tree, against
which it leaned itself in helpless agony,
whilst its pursuer seated himself in front
of it, in safety, to <i>boil his coffee</i>, and
observe its sufferings. The story is
continued as follows:—“Having admired
him for a considerable time, <i>I
resolved to make experiments on vulnerable
points</i>; and approaching very
near I fired several bullets at different
parts of his enormous skull. He only
acknowledged the shots by a salaam-like
movement of his trunk, with the point
of which he gently touched the wounds
with a striking and peculiar action.
Surprised and shocked at finding that
I was only prolonging the sufferings of
the noble beast, which bore its trials
with such dignified composure, I resolved
to finish the proceeding with
all possible despatch, and accordingly
opened fire upon him from the left side,
aiming at the shoulder. I first fired
<i>six</i> shots with the two-grooved rifle,
which must have eventually proved
mortal. After which I fired <i>six</i> shots
at the same part with the Dutch six-pounder.
<i>Large tears now trickled
from his eyes, which he slowly shut and
opened, his colossal frame shivered
convulsively, and falling on his side,
he expired.</i>” (Vol. ii. p. 10.)
</p>
<p>
In another place, after detailing the
manner in which he assailed a poor
animal, he says: “I was loading and
firing as fast as could be, sometimes at
the head, sometimes behind the shoulder,
until my elephant’s fore-quarter
was a mass of gore; notwithstanding
which he continued to hold on, leaving
the grass and branches of the forest
scarlet in his wake.... Having
fired <i>thirty-five rounds</i> with my two-grooved
rifle, I opened upon him with
the Dutch six-pounder, and when forty
bullets had perforated his hide, he began
for the first time to evince signs of a
dilapidated constitution.” The disgusting
description is closed thus:
“Throughout the charge he repeatedly
cooled his person with large quantities
of water, which he ejected from his
trunk over his sides and back, and just
as the pangs of death came over him,
he stood trembling violently beside a
thorn tree, and kept pouring water
into his bloody mouth until he died,
when he pitched heavily forward with
the whole weight of his fore-quarters
resting on the points of his tusks. The
strain was fair, and the tusks did not
yield; but the portion of his head in
which the tusks were embedded, extending
a long way above the eye,
yielded and burst with a muffled crash.”

the elephant is supposed to reconnoitre

made “pits some fathoms deep in those

himself taken unawares. Thereafter
being subdued by fright and exhaustion,
he was assisted to raise himself to the

readiness to tie him up to the nearest
tree.” (See <span class="smcap">Wolf’s</span> <i>Life and Adventures</i>,

taking elephants in pitfalls: Decius,

in the Regent’s Park, in 1851, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>, the Secretary, caused measurements

found the statement of the Singhalese
hunters to be strictly correct, the height
at the shoulders being precisely twice
the circumference of the fore foot. In
an African elephant killed by Sir S.

at the head of the Commission of Roads,
in Ceylon, in writing to me, mentions an
anecdote illustrative of the daring of
the Panickeas. “I once saw,” he says,
“a very beautiful example of the confidence
with which these fellows, from
their knowledge of the elephants, meet
their worst defiance. It was in Neuera-Kalawa;
I was bivouacking on the
bank of a river, and had been kept out
so late that I did not get to my tent
until between 9 and 10 at night. On
our return towards it we passed several
single elephants making their way to
the nearest water, but at length we came
upon a large herd that had taken possession
of the only road by which we
could pass, and which no intimidation
would induce to move off. I had some
Panickeas with me; they knew the
herd, and counselled extreme caution.
After trying every device we could
think of for a length of time, a little old
Moorman of the party came to me and
requested we should all retire to a
distance. He then took a couple of
chules (flambeaux of dried wood, or
coco-nut leaves), one in each hand, and
waving them above his head till they
flamed out fiercely, he advanced at a
deliberate pace to within a few yards of
the elephant who was acting as leader
of the party, and who was growling
and trumpeting in his rage, and flourished
the flaming torches in his face.
The effect was instantaneous; the
whole herd dashed away in a panic,
bellowing, screaming, and crushing
through the underwood, whilst we availed
ourselves of the open path to make
our way to our tents.”</p></div>

taking of Elephants in Ceylon, by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Strachan</span>, a Physician who lived
seventeen years there,” in which the
author describes the manner in which
they were shipped by the Dutch, at
Matura, Galle, and Negombo. A piece
of strong sail-cloth having been wrapped
round the elephant’s chest and stomach
he was forced into the sea between two
tame ones, and there made fast to a
boat. The tame ones then returned to
land, and he swam after the boat to the
ship, where tackle was reeved to the
sail-cloth, and he was hoisted on board.

“But a better way has been invented
lately,” says Mr. Strachan; “a large
flat-bottomed vessel is prepared, covered
with planks like a floor; so that this
floor is almost of a height with the key.
Then the sides of the key and the
vessel are adorned with green branches,
so that the elephant sees no water till
he is in the ship.” (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>

<p><a name="Footnote_133_133" id="Footnote_133_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133_133"><span class="label">133</span></a> The surprising faculty of vultures
for discovering carrion, has been a
subject of much speculation, as to whether
it be dependent on their power of
sight or of scent. It is not, however,
more mysterious than the unerring certainty
and rapidity with which some of
the minor animals, and more especially
insects, in warm climates congregate
around the offal on which they feed.
Circumstanced as they are, they must
be guided towards their object mainly
if not exclusively by the sense of smell;
but that which excites astonishment is
the small degree of odour which seems
to suffice for the purpose; the subtlety
and rapidity with which it traverses and
impregnates the air; and the keen and
quick perception with which it is taken
up by the organs of those creatures.
The instance of the scavenger beetles
has been already alluded to; the
promptitude with which they discern
the existence of matter suited to their
purposes, and the speed with which
they hurry to it from all directions;
often from distances as extraordinary,
proportionably, as those traversed by
the eye of the vulture. In the instance
of the dying elephant referred to above,
life was barely extinct when the flies, of
which not one was visible but a moment
before, arrived in clouds and blackened
the body by their multitude; scarcely
an instant was allowed to elapse for the
commencement of decomposition; no
odour of putrefaction could be discerned
by us who stood close by; yet some
peculiar smell of mortality, simultaneously
with parting breath, must have
summoned them to the feast. Ants exhibit
an instinct equally surprising.
I have sometimes covered up a particle
of refined sugar with paper on the centre
of a polished table; and counted
the number of minutes which would
elapse before it was fastened on by the
small black ants of Ceylon, and a line
formed to lower it safely to the floor.
Here was a substance which, to our
apprehension at least, is altogether
inodorous, and yet the quick sense of
smell must have been the only conductor
of the ants. It has been observed of
those fishes which travel overland on
the evaporation of the ponds in which
they live, that they invariably march in
the direction of the nearest water, and
even when captured, and placed on the
floor of a room, their efforts to escape
are always made towards the same
point. Is the sense of smell sufficient
to account for this display of instinct
in them? or is it aided by special
organs in the case of the others? Dr.
<span class="smcap">McGee</span>, formerly of the <span class="smcap">Royal Navy</span>,
writing to me on the subject of the
instant appearance of flies in the vicinity
of dead bodies, says: “In warm climates
they do not wait for death to
invite them to the banquet. In Jamaica
I have again and again seen them settle
on a patient, and hardly to be driven
away by the nurse, the patient himself
saying, ‘Here are these flies coming to
eat me ere I am dead.’ At times they
have enabled the doctor, when otherwise
he would have been in doubt as to
his prognosis, to determine whether the
strange apyretic interval occasionally
present in the last stage of yellow fever
was the fatal lull or the lull of recovery;
and ‘What say the flies?’ has been
the settling question. Among many,
many cases during a long period I have
seen but one recovery after the assembling
of the flies. I consider the foregoing
as a confirmation of smell being
the guide even to the attendants, a
cadaverous smell has been perceived to
arise from the body of a patient twenty-four
hours before death.”</p></div>

“Il faut remarquer ici une chose
qu’on aura peut-être de la peine à
croire mais qui est toutefois très-véritable:
c’est que lorsque quelque
roi ou quelque seigneur a quelqu’un
de ces éléphants de Ceylan, et qu’on

les marchands vont les prendre, comme
d’Achen, de Siam, d’Arakan, de Pégu,
du royaume de Boutan, d’Assam, des terres
de Cochin et de la côte du Mélinde,
dès que les éléphants en voient un de
Ceylan, par un instinct de nature, ils
lui font la révérence, portant le bout
de leur trompe à la terre et la relevant.
Il est vrai que les éléphants que les
grands seigneurs entretiennent, quand
on les amène devant eux, pour voir s’ils
sont en bon point, font trois fois une
espèce de révérence avec leur trompe,

in Sacred History is in the account
given in <i>Maccabees</i> of the invasion of
Egypt by Antiochus, who entered it
170 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, “with chariots and elephants,
and horsemen, and a great navy.”
(1 Macc. i. 17.) Frequent allusions to
the use of elephants in war occur in
both books: and in chap. vi. 34, it is
stated that “to provoke the elephants
to fight they show them the blood of
grapes and of mulberries.” The term
showed, ἔδειξαν, might be thought to
imply that the animals were enraged
by the sight of the wine and its colour,
but in the Third Book of Maccabees,
in the Greek Septuagint, various other
passages show that wine, on such occasions,
was administered to the elephants
to render them furious. (Macc. v. 2, 10,
45.) <span class="smcap">Phile</span> mentions the same fact, <i>De

There is a very curious account of
the mode in which the Arab conquerors
of Scinde, in the 9th and 10th centuries,
equipped the elephant for war; which
being written with all the particularity

truth and accuracy. <span class="smcap">Massoudi</span>, who

island of Ceylon:—from a larger account
of his journeys he compiled a
summary under the title of “<i>Moroudj
al-dzeheb</i>” or the “<i>Golden Meadows</i>,”
the MS. of which is now in the Bibliothèque
Nationale. <span class="smcap">M. Reinaud</span>, in
describing this manuscript, says, on its
authority, “The Prince of Mensura,
whose dominions lay south of the Indus,
maintained eighty elephants trained for
war, each of which bore in his trunk a
bent cymeter (carthel), with which he
was taught to cut and thrust at all confronting
him. The trunk itself was
effectually protected by a coat of mail,
and the rest of the body enveloped in a
covering composed jointly of iron and
horn. Other elephants were employed
in drawing chariots, carrying baggage,
and grinding forage, and the performance
of all bespoke the utmost intelligence
and docility.”—<span class="smcap">Reinaud</span>, <i>Mémoire

<i>Mirabilia Descripta</i>, written about the
year 1330, thus describes the mode then
in use for taming captured elephants in
Cambodia:—“And so the wild elephant
remaineth caught between the
two gates. Then cometh a man <i>clothed
in black or red, with his face covered</i>,
who cruelly thrashes him from above,
and crieth out cruelly against him as
against a ‘thief!’ and this goeth on for
five or six days; without his getting
anything to eat or drink. Then cometh
another man with <i>his face bare and
clad in another colour</i>, who feigneth
to smite the first man, and to drive and
thrust him away. Then he cometh to
the elephant and talketh to him, and
with a long spear he scratcheth him,
and he kisses him and gives him food.
And this goes on for ten or fifteen days,
and so by degrees he ventureth down
beside him and bindeth him to another
elephant. And then after about twenty
days he may be taken out to be taught
and broken in.” (Chap. v.)</p></div>

had been tamed in Ceylon; he measured
upwards of nine feet at the shoulders,
and belonged to the caste so highly
prized for the temples. He was gentle
after his first capture, but his removal
from the corral to the stables, though
only a distance of six miles, was a
matter of the extremest difficulty: his
extraordinary strength rendering him
more than a match for the attendant
decoys. He on one occasion escaped,
but was recaptured in the forest; and
he afterwards became so docile as to
perform a variety of tricks. He was
at length ordered to be removed to
Colombo; but such was his terror on
approaching the fort, that on coaxing
him to enter the gate, he became
paralysed in the extraordinary way
elsewhere alluded to, and died on the
spot.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_146_146" id="Footnote_146_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146_146"><span class="label">146</span></a> The natives of Ceylon profess that
the high-caste elephants, such as are
allotted to the temples, are of all others
the most difficult to tame, and <span class="smcap">M.
Bles</span>, the Dutch correspondent of <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>,
mentions a caste of elephants
which he had heard of, as being peculiar
to the Kandyan kingdom, that
were not higher than a heifer (génisse),
covered with hair, and insusceptible of
being tamed. (<span class="smcap">Buffon</span>, <i>Supp.</i> vol. vi.
p. 29.) Bishop <span class="smcap">Heber</span>, in the account
of his journey from Bareilly towards
the Himalayas, describes the Raja
Gourman Sing, “mounted on a little
female elephant, hardly bigger than a
Durham ox, and almost as shaggy as a
poodle.” (<i>Journ.</i> ch. xvii.) It will be
remembered that the mammoth discovered
in 1803 embedded in icy soil
in Siberia, was covered with a coat of
long hair, with a sort of wool at the
roots. Hence there arose the question
whether that northern region had been
formerly inhabited by a race of elephants,
so fortified by nature against
cold; or whether the individual discovered
had been borne thither by currents
from some more temperate latitudes.
To the latter theory the presence
of hair seemed a fatal objection; but so
far as my own observation goes, I
believe the elephants are more or less
provided with hair. In some it is more
developed than in others, and it is particularly
observable in the young, which
when captured are frequently covered
with a woolly fleece, especially about
the head and shoulders. In the older
individuals in Ceylon, this is less apparent;
and in captivity the hair appears
to be altogether removed by the
custom of the mahouts to rub their
skin daily with oil and a rough lump of
burned clay. See a paper on the subject,
<i>Asiat. Journ.</i> N. S. vol. xiv. p.
182, by Mr. <span class="smcap">G. Fairholme</span>. Fossil
remains of elephants of extremely small
dimensions have, it is said, been discovered
in the island of Malta.</p></div>

of an Embassy to Ava in 1855</i>, records
an illustration of this tendency of the
elephant to sudden death; one newly
captured, the process of taming which
was exhibited to the British Envoy,
“made vigorous resistance to the placing
of a collar on its neck, and the
people were proceeding to tighten it,
when the elephant, which had lain
down as if quite exhausted, reared suddenly
on the hind quarters, and fell on
its side—<i>dead!</i>” (P. 104.)
</p>
<p>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Strachan</span> noticed the same liability
of the elephants to sudden death
from very slight causes; “if they fall,”
he says, “at any time, though on plain
ground, they either die immediately, or
languish till they die; their great
weight occasioning them so much hurt
by the fall.” (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1701,

handsome, but not strong enough to
resist the inconceivable strength of the
mighty monarch of these forests; almost
every tree had half its branches
broken short by them, and at every
hundred yards I came upon entire trees,
and these, <i>the largest in the forest</i>,
uprooted clean out of the ground, and
<i>broken short across their stems</i>.” (<i>A
Hunter’s Life in South Africa.</i> By
<span class="smcap">R. Gordon Cumming</span>, vol.ii. p.305.)
“Spreading out from one another, they
smash and destroy all the finest trees

forests where the trees thus broken lay
so thick across one another, that it was
almost impossible to ride through the

</p>
<p>
Mr. Gordon Cumming does not name
the trees which he saw thus “uprooted”
and “broken across,” nor has he given
any idea of their size and weight; but
Major <span class="smcap">Denham</span>, who observed like
traces of the elephant in Africa, saw
only small trees overthrown by them;
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Pringle</span>, who had an opportunity
of observing similar practices of
the animals in the neutral territory
of the Eastern frontier of the Cape of
Good Hope, describes their ravages as
being confined to the mimosas, “immense
numbers of which had been torn
out of the ground, and placed in an
inverted position, in order to enable
the animals to browse at their ease on
the soft and juicy roots, which form a
favourite part of their food. Many of
the <i>larger mimosas had resisted all
their efforts; and indeed it is only
after heavy rain, when the soil is soft
and loose, that they ever successfully
attempt this operation</i>.” (<span class="smcap">Pringle’s</span>
<i>Sketches of South Africa</i>.) Sir <span class="smcap">S.
Baker</span>, whose observation confirms my
own, as to the limited dimensions of the
trees overthrown by elephants in Ceylon,
says that in the vicinity of the
White Nile, where the principal food of
the elephant is the mimosa, he saw trees
uprooted by them, which measured
30 feet high and 4 feet 6 inches in
diameter. But he is “convinced that
no single elephant could have overturned
them; and the natives assured
him that they mutually assist one
another, and that several engage together
in the work of overthrowing a
large tree; the powerful tushes of some
being applied as crowbars in the roots
while others pull at the branches
their trunks.” (<i>The Albert Nyanz</i>
vol. i. p. 276.)</p></div>

mahouts in Ceylon direct the motions
of the elephants is a repetition, with
various modulations, of the words
<i>ur-re! ur-re!</i> This is one of those
interjections in which the sound is so
expressive of the sense that persons in
charge of animals of almost every description
throughout the world appear
to have adopted it with a concurrence
that is very curious. The drivers of
camels in Turkey, Palestine, and
Egypt encourage them to speed by
shouting <i>ar-ré! ar-ré!</i> The Arabs in
Algeria cry <i>eirich!</i> to their mules.
The Moors seem to have carried the
custom with them into Spain, where
mules are still driven with cries of <i>arré</i>
(whence the muleteers derive their
Spanish appellation of “arrieros”).
In France the sportsman excites the
hound by shouts of <i>hare! hare!</i> and
the waggoner there turns his horses by
his voice, and the use of the word
<i>hurhaut!</i> In the North, “<i>Hurs</i> was
a word used by the old Germans in
urging their horses to speed:” and Sir
<span class="smcap">Francis Head</span>, in his <i>Bubbles from
the Brunnens</i>, describes the Schwin-General
shouting “<i>ariff</i>” to his pigs...“<i>ariff!</i>
vociferated the old man,
striding after one of his rebellious subjects;
<i>ariff!</i> re-echoed his boy striding
after another.” (P.94.)
</p>
<p>
To the present day, the herdsmen in
Ireland, and parts of Scotland, drive
their pigs with shouts of <i>hurrish!</i> a
sound closely resembling that used by
the mahouts in Ceylon.</p></div>

the undivided attention of <i>three</i>
men. One, as his mahout or superintendent,
and two as leaf-cutters, who
bring him branches and grass for his
daily supplies. An animal of larger
growth would probably require a third
leaf-cutter. The daily consumption is
two cwt. of green food with about half
a bushel of grain. When in the vicinity
of towns and villages, the attendants
have no difficulty in procuring an
abundant supply of the branches of the
trees to which elephants are partial;
and in journeys through the forests and
unopened country, the leaf-cutters are
sufficiently expert in the knowledge of
those particular plants with which the
elephant is satisfied. Those that would
be likely to disagree with him he unerringly
rejects. His favourites are the
palms, especially the cluster of rich,
unopened leaves, known as the “cabbage,”
of the coco-nut and areca; and
he delights to tear open the young
trunks of the palmyra and jaggery
(<i>Caryota urens</i>) in search of the farinaceous
matter contained in the spongy
pith. Next to these come the varieties
of fig-trees, particularly the sacred <i>Bo</i>
(<i>F. religiosa</i>) which is found near every
temple, and the <i>na gaha</i> (<i>Messua ferrea</i>),
with thick dark leaves and a scarlet
flower. The leaves of the jak-tree
and bread-fruit (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>,
and <i>A. incisa</i>), the wood apple
(<i>Ægle Marmelos</i>), Palu (<i>Mimusops
Indica</i>), and a number of others well
known to their attendants, are all consumed
in turn. The stems of the plaintain,
the stalks of the sugar-cane, and
the feathery tops of the bamboos, are
irresistible luxuries. Pine-apples, water-melons,
and fruits of every description,
are voraciously devoured, and a coconut
when found is first rolled under
foot to detach it from the husk and
fibre, and then raised in his trunk and
crushed almost without an effort, by
his ponderous jaws.
</p>
<p>
The grasses are not found in sufficient
quantity to be an item of daily
fodder; the Mauritius or the Guinea
grass is seized with avidity; lemon
grass is rejected from its overpowering
perfume, but rice in the straw, and
every description of grain, whether
growing or dry; gram (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>),
Indian corn, and millet, are his
natural food. Of such of these as can
be found, it is the duty of the leaf-cutters,
when in the jungle and on
march, to provide a daily supply.</p></div>

across one of the paths to which
the elephants resort in their frequent

proceedings two of the captured elephants
died. Their carcases were left
of course within the enclosure, which
was abandoned as soon as the capture
was complete. The wild elephants resumed
their path through it, and a few
days afterwards the headman reported
to Mr. Morris that the bodies had been
removed and carried outside the corral
to a spot to which nothing but the elephants
could have borne them.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>‘<i>Homes Without Hands</i> is more interesting
than a fairy tale, and shews
how highly endowed are the inferior
races, which from the very first produced
in perfection works to which
the nobler intellect of man could attain
only after the discipline and experience
of centuries. There is scarcely an invention
of man of which the prototype
may not be discovered in the great
patent office of Nature, nor a mechanical
contrivance in which he has
not been anticipated by the insects
and animals which he is in the habit
of regarding with contempt, if not
with loathing. The invention of paper
was a new era in human history, but
wasps made veritable paper and papier-mâché
from the beginning of the
world. Mankind waited through thousands
of years for Professor <span class="smcap">Wheatstone</span>
to invent the electric telegraph,
but the Arachnidæ had their lines in
operation on the morning when <span class="smcap">Adam</span>
first opened his eyes upon the world.
The beaver was from the beginning
conversant with the strength and
virtues of the arch; the burrowing
spider made use of the poppet valve;
and as for the bearings of timbers
and the strength of materials, birds,
beasts, and insects were well acquainted
with them thousands of
years before <span class="smcap">Vitruvius</span> or <span class="smcap">Tredgold</span>
or <span class="smcap">Fairbairn</span> was born. The
Author, in a fascinating style and
with a profusion of elegant engravings,
illustrates instinctive art in all
its departments, from the labours of
the smallest insect up to those of the
largest animal which builds itself a
dwelling. To enumerate the wonders
contained in the book we should be
compelled to write an abstract of its
contents, for each page contains something
that will interest and delight
the reader. It is a work calculated to
bring pleasures of the most rational
and elevating kind into many a school-room
and many a family circle during
the Christmas season; and certainly
it would be impossible to recommend
a more suitable book for a present to
a young person.’ <span class="smcap">Daily News.</span></p>

<big><big><big>THE HARMONIES OF NATURE;</big></big></big><br />

OR, THE UNITY OF CREATION.<br />

BY DR. GEORGE HARTWIG.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dr. Hartwig</span> has produced another
delightful and instructive volume, in
which he illustrates the wonders of
wisdom and knowledge with which
creation teems. The opening chapters
are devoted to a recapitulation of some
of the magnificent and astonishing
phænomena which are observed in the
heavens, air, and sea, by way of developing
the harmony which is the
universal law of nature. But throughout
the greater part of the work the
Author confines himself to the domains
of vegetable and animal life; and here
he accumulates a surprising number
of evidences of design, adaptation of
power, and inexhaustible resource.
The work exhibits a very unusual and
most felicitous combination of accurate
and varied erudition with clear and
popular writing. It is a true instructor;
for both the descriptions
and the woodcuts with which they
are accompanied are scientifically correct,
while the narration is full of
almost romantic interest. Each page
has some new wonder to enchant the
youthful reader and excite the reverent
admiration of the thoughtful....
The reverence and piety of Dr.
<span class="smcap">Hartwig’s</span> works are a great recommendation
in days when scientific men
seem to think their first duty in speaking
or writing is to avoid every word
that could possibly suggest the idea
of a personal Deity and intelligent
Creator.’ <span class="smcap">Patriot.</span></p>

size of the book is increased by a
hundred pages; a good deal of it is
remoulded; two whole new chapters
have been added, one on Marine Caves,
the other on Marine Constructions,
such as Lighthouses and Breakwaters;
some of the old illustrations have disappeared,
but their place has been
supplied by more and better; so that
the new edition really amounts to a
recasting of the entire book. It was a
very good book before; it is better and
more complete now. Whether we regard

none among ornamental and popular

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
